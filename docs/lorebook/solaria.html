                    <span class="section-ornament">⸺ ☼ ⸺</span>
                </h2>
                <p><strong>Solaria</strong> is a form of cosmic energy discovered and harnessed by Mesoamerican
                    civilizations, most
                    notably the <span class="tooltip">Tenochca</span>, through a sophisticated system of engineering.
                </p>
                <p>It bears no resemblance to the supernatural in the traditional sense: it is a scientific interaction
                    with solar
                    energy, channeled and distributed through ritual structures such as pyramids, stelae, and solar
                    calendars. The
                    “magic” of the New World is, in truth, an occult but natural branch of physics.</p>
                <p>Anyone within the New World is exposed to the energy flows transmitted by this ancient network — and
                    can learn to
                    harness them.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        “What you call sorcery is but the science of antiquity — a science our instruments are not yet
                        refined enough to discern.”</p>

                <h4>Nomenclature</h4>
                <p>This power goes by different names, depending on the culture interpreting it:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong class="highlight">Solaria</strong> — the more “scientific” European term, commonly used
                        by Seekers</li>
                    <li><strong class="highlight">Tonalli</strong> — from Nahuatl: the vital energy radiated by the Sun
                    </li>
                    <li><strong class="highlight">Xiuhtlalpan</strong> — from Nahuatl: “sacred field of energy,” used by
                        the Aztecs</li>
                    <li><strong class="highlight">Æther Solis</strong> — a syncretic term favored by Renaissance
                        alchemists</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Why is Solaria active only in the New World?</h3>
                <p><strong>Solaria</strong> is accessible exclusively within a geospatial transmission network composed
                    of ritually engineered structures — including pyramids, temples, stone calendars, cenotes, obelisks,
                    and ceremonial complexes. These constructions act as amplifiers, transmitters, and stabilizers for
                    an energy field derived from solar radiation and cosmic frequencies.</p>
                <p>This network performs four primary functions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong class="highlight">Celestial Alignment</strong>. The sites are precisely oriented with
                        key astronomical events such as solstices, equinoxes, and stellar conjunctions, enabling
                        resonance with solar and cosmic cycles.</li>
                    <li><strong class="highlight">Geomagnetic Anchoring</strong>. The network is built on natural
                        telluric nodes, where Earth’s magnetic field is unusually strong or unstable, enhancing energy
                        absorption and transmission.</li>
                    <li><strong class="highlight">Conductive Materials</strong>. The structures incorporate minerals
                        such as basalt, obsidian, jade, or copper, which exhibit high conductivity and resonance
                        properties, aiding storage and modulation of the energy field.</li>
                    <li><strong class="highlight">Ritual Geometry</strong>. The architecture follows specific geometric
                        patterns derived from sacred numerology and fractal harmonics, stabilizing the field and
                        preventing dissipation or decoherence.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These factors combine to create a continuous transmission grid across the New World, forming
                    large-scale <em>active zones</em> where Solaria is present, stable, and accessible.</p>
                <p>Europe and the Old World lack this network; without equivalent structures, alignments, or geomagnetic
                    focal points, the energy field cannot manifest. Even if knowledge or artifacts are brought back,
                    Solaria remains dormant — its activation depends on a functioning transmission infrastructure, not
                    belief or ritual alone.</p>

                    How Does Solaria Work?
                    <span class="section-ornament">⸺ ☼ ⸺</span>
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Solaria behaves as both a physical energy field and an informational medium — meaning it not only
                    exerts force or transmits power, but also stores and responds to encoded data, much like a primitive
                    computer system embedded in the fabric of the world.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Mexica engineered a sophisticated system to interact with this energy. It functions through four
                    interdependent mechanisms:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Absorption</strong> of solar energy through sacred materials (volcanic stone, obsidian,
                        sacred water, gold, etc.).</li>
                    <li><strong>Modulation</strong> via carvings, sigils, and ritual architecture, which shape and
                        redirect the energy flow.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transmission</strong> through a network of resonant structures (pyramids, stelae,
                        cenotes), acting as amplifiers and conductors.</li>
                    <li><strong>Activation</strong> triggered by specific stimuli — sounds, light, blood, thought —
                        properly encoded into ritual patterns.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    These components function because Solaria is <em>resonant</em>: it responds to harmonic frequencies,
                    geometric regularities, and symbolic structure. Sacred materials contain crystalline or magnetic
                    properties that enhance this interaction. The structures themselves are built according to
                    principles of sacred geometry and astronomical alignment, ensuring resonance with cosmic rhythms.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Activation stimuli are essential: without them, the system remains dormant. These inputs must match
                    Solaria’s “language” — structured and coherent patterns that function as keys. Improper or random
                    input is simply ignored by the field.
                </p>

                </div>

                <p>
                    These stimuli work only when properly encoded — through specific gestures, sigils, languages, and
                    tools. Random or incorrect input has no measurable effect.
                </p>

                <h3>Scientific Hypotheses</h3>
                <p>
                    Scholars on both sides of the Atlantic have begun to study Solaria not as “magic,” but as a form of
                    pre-modern science. The following are the main working theories proposed in academic circles:

                            </tr>
                            <tr>

                <h3>Practical Use</h3>
                <p>Solaria is not free-form magic. To harness it, characters must:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Be within an active field (near a Solaria node such as a temple or cenote).</li>
                    <li>Possess ritual components (masks, tattoos, obsidian tools, written glyphs).</li>
                    <li>Execute codified actions (chants, diagrams, offerings, visualizations).</li>
                    <li>Understand part of the symbolic or linguistic framework.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Effects vary widely — from healing and perception alteration to matter manipulation — but each must
                    be constructed from meaningful, codified elements.</p>

                <h3>Who Can Use Solaria?</h3>
                <p>Access requires two conditions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Location:</strong> The user must be within an active Solaria field, a widely distributed
                        network ensuring most gameplay areas support magical use. Temporary absence from these zones is
                        a narrative tool, not a mechanical restriction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Biological Compatibility:</strong> Native Mesoamericans naturally interface with
                        Solaria. Foreigners such as Seekers undergo ritual transformation — often involving Aztec blood
                        infusion or symbolic attunement — to alter their energy matrix, enabling perception and

                    Aspects of Solaria

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Among those who have been altered by the <strong>Solaria field</strong>, patterns have emerged —
                    recurring bonds between the Seeker’s will and specific manifestations of primal force. These
                    patterns are known as <strong>Aspects</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each Aspect resonates with a particular archetypal creature — not merely symbolic, but biologically
                    and spiritually attuned to the pulse of Solaria. They represent an arcane synthesis: a deliberate
                    attempt by the ancient Mesoamerican magi to <em>engineer power</em> by encoding the virtues of
                    beasts into human form.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Aspects do not grant shapeshifting or bestial features (though some mutations are common), but
                    rather influence how the Seeker channels magical energy, reacts to stimuli, and alters the world
                    through Solaria.
                </p>

                    While every Seeker can learn to draw upon the Solaria field, those with a dominant Aspect find
                    their abilities shaped by deeper instincts — a buried code, awakened through ritual exposure and
                    irreversible mutation.

                <h4>Energy Condensers</h4>
                <p>
                    The vast geoglyphs carved into the Peruvian desert are <strong>ritual condensers</strong>
                    designed to align with celestial routes of Solaria. At specific solar positions, blood-ritual
                    activations concentrate energy along the lines and channel it toward distant temples.

                <h4>Bio-Calibration</h4>
                <p>
                    Human hearts acted as <strong>bio-nodes</strong> saturated with Solaria. Large-scale
                    sacrifices recalibrated the network, stabilizing power flows after eclipses, droughts, or
                    territorial shifts.

                <h4>Vertical Antennae</h4>
                <p>
                    Sacred sinkholes function as <strong>vertical antennas</strong> that draw cosmic charge
                    into the ground water. Offerings—occasionally living—served as <em>catalysts</em>,
                    enabling high-intensity rituals linked to weather control and healing.

                <h4>Temporal Protocols</h4>
                <p>
                    The <em>Tonalpohualli</em> and <em>Xiuhpohualli</em> are not mere calendars; they are
                    <strong>temporal coding systems</strong>. Each day-glyph combination unlocks a distinct
                    Solarian “protocol,” allowing practitioners to access specialized effects or visions.

                <h4>Frequency Modulators</h4>
                <p>
                    Every tier represents a discrete <strong>resonant band</strong>. Ascending a pyramid
                    progressively modulates Solaria, with the summit acting as a high-gain transmitter that
                    propagates ritual commands throughout the continental grid.

                <h4>Bio-Interfaces</h4>
                <p>
                    Gem-inlaid skulls and obsidian masks serve as <strong>frequency shifters</strong>,
                    letting the wearer harmonize personal energy with deific or animalistic patterns stored
                    in the network.

                <h4>Programming Language</h4>
                <p>
                    Classical Nahuatl forms the <strong>programming lexicon</strong> of Solaria. Words,
                    glyphs, and tonal accents act as command strings that call specific routines in the
                    energy field.
