                </header>
                <p>Exploration in <em>Seeker</em> is not a passive journey, but a structured game of discovery where
                    each
                    step into the unknown reshapes the map. Instead of moving across a pre-drawn landscape, the Seekers
                    reveal
                    one hex at a time, building the New World as they advance. This procedural system ensures that no
                    expedition
                    is ever the same, and that each choice carries weight and consequence.</p>

                <p>The exploration is a contest of intent between the Archivist and the Seekers. The Archivist
                    introduces
                    uncertainty and hardship by generating the terrain, anomalies, and dangers of each new hex. The
                    Seekers,
                    through their skills, masteries, and resources, attempt to mitigate risks, exploit opportunities,
                    and
                    transform a hostile land into one they can traverse and survive. Every revealed hex becomes a
                    strategic
                    battleground between adversity and adaptation.</p>

                <p>This process balances randomness and agency. Dice rolls inject unpredictability, shaping dangers,
                    features,
                    and events; but the Seekers’ decisions—whether to press forward, scout, or retreat—determine how
                    harshly
                    those results impact their journey. The challenge is not simply to endure, but to manage resources,
                    exploit
                    discoveries, and anticipate what lies beyond the next edge of the map.</p>

                <p>At its heart, exploration is a cycle of risk and reward. The Seekers must accept hardship, seize rare
                    opportunities, and endure unexpected dangers. Boldness is rewarded, caution preserves survival, and
                    every
                    hex revealed is another fragment of a living world influenced by Solaria’s presence. This system
                    transforms
                    travel into a tense, evolving narrative where the landscape itself is both adversary and treasure.

                    <p class="subtitle">Division of Duties and Leadership in Exploration</p>
                </header>

                <p>Before embarking on an expedition, each Seeker must decide whether to take on a specific role within
                    the party. These roles represent historical functions within real expeditions and grant access to
                    Skills and Masteries that only those roles can employ. The choice of roles defines how the
                    expedition is organized, where leadership lies, and how resources are managed during the journey.
                </p>

                <h3>Assignment Rules</h3>
                <p>The following rules define how roles are assigned within the group:</p>
                <ul class="diamond">
                    <li>Each Seeker may take at most one role.</li>
                    <li>It is not mandatory to cover all available roles.</li>
                    <li>At least one Seeker must be assigned as <strong>Captain</strong>.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Procedure</h3>
                <p>At the start of the expedition, the party decides collectively who fills which role. This decision is
                    locked for the duration of the journey: roles may only be reassigned once the expedition is
                    concluded and the Seekers return to a safe haven.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Before setting out into unknown territory, the group assigns Roles. Isabel chooses Captain, Diego
                        takes Scout, while Rodrigo assumes the role of Quartermaster.</p>

                    <p>During exploration, Diego uses his Scout Skill to automatically learn what <u>Danger</u> lies in
                        the next hex. Later, Rodrigo’s Quartermaster Mastery increases the <u>Supplies</u> found when
                        harvesting by +1. At the expedition’s end, Isabel’s Captain Mastery restores 3 <u>Morale</u>
                        spent during the journey (equal to her Charisma score).</p>
                </blockquote>

                <h3>Roles</h3>
                <p>The following roles provide different
                    ways of interacting with the world:</p>
                <ul class="no-bullet">
                    <li><strong class="highlight">Captain | Capitán</strong> — The leader of the expedition. Responsible
                        for discipline, morale, and
                        the ultimate direction of the journey. The Captain embodies authority and vision.</li>
                    <li><strong class="highlight">Quartermaster | Furriel</strong> — Oversees supplies, provisions, and
                        the fair distribution of
                        resources. Keeps the group alive by preventing scarcity and mismanagement.</li>
                    <li><strong class="highlight">Scout | Explorador</strong> — Guides the party through unknown
                        terrain, identifying dangers and paths
                        ahead. The Scout represents keen senses and survival instincts.</li>
                    <li><strong class="highlight">Chaplain | Capellán</strong> Provides spiritual guidance and a moral
                        compass. The Chaplain can
                        inspire hope, faith, or fear, depending on the beliefs carried into the wilderness.</li>
                    <li><strong class="highlight">Chronicler | Cronista</strong> — Records the events of the expedition,
                        maps lands, and preserves
                        knowledge for posterity. Their presence ensures discoveries are not lost to memory.</li>
                    <li><strong class="highlight">Navigator | Navegante</strong> — Master of the stars, maps, and
                        instruments. The Navigator ensures
                        the group knows where it stands and how to reach its destination.</li>
                    <li><strong class="highlight">Artillerist | Artillero</strong> — Maintains and commands the
                        expedition’s weapons, from arquebuses
                        to cannons. The Artillerist embodies firepower and intimidation.</li>
                    <li><strong class="highlight">Interpreter | Interprete</strong> — Bridges languages and cultures,
                        allowing parley or deception. The
                        Interpreter is often the thin line between diplomacy and conflict.</li>

                    Exploration is a collective endeavor. The group shares and manages key resources that
                    measure both physical supplies and intangible resilience. Skills and Masteries can
                    affect how efficiently these resources are spent or recovered, but their scarcity
                    always defines the rhythm of an expedition.

                            <span class="iconize">Supplies</span> is tracked as a shared party resource. The starting
                            value
                            depends on your preparation, chosen Equipment, and certain Masteries. Supplies are consumed
                            during travel, resting, or when specific abilities require expendable goods. Running out of
                            <span class="iconize">Supplies</span> exposes the group to hunger, thirst, fatigue, and
                            other
                            escalating hardships.
                        </p>

                        <h4>When It Applies</h4>
                        <p>
                            Any extended expedition, overland journey, or dangerous environment requires
                            <span class="iconize">Supplies</span>. They are spent daily for basic survival and may also
                            be consumed to boost certain actions, such as treating wounds, preparing equipment, or
                            enduring extreme conditions. If <span class="iconize">Supplies</span>
                            reaches 0, the group suffers penalties to Health recovery, Morale, and effectiveness
                            in exploration.
                        </p>

                        <h4>How to Interact With It</h4>
                        <p>
                            You can restore <span class="iconize">Supplies</span>
                            by resupplying in settlements, scavenging in the wild, or trading with other groups.
                            Some Skills or Masteries allow you to stretch existing stocks further, improvise
                            substitutes,
                            or prevent spoilage. Wise management of
                            <span class="iconize">Supplies</span> often means the difference between reaching your
                            destination or collapsing along the way.

                            Morale can be restored by achieving victories, sharing spoils, celebrating, or reinforcing

                            while some Skills or Masteries help mitigate fear or restore confidence. Conversely,

                                It is less about skill or willpower, and more about being in the right

                            Luck can be restored rarely—through sacred rituals, blessings, divine omens,
                            or rare artifacts said to carry fate’s blessing. Some Masteries allow
                            Seekers to “push” fortune in their favor, though every use risks
                            drawing fate’s attention. Reckless overreliance on
                            <span class="iconize">Luck</span> can quickly drain it, leaving the group at the
                            mercy of cruel destiny.

                <h4>Supplies and Attrition</h4>
                <p>
                    When resources run out, Seekers begin to suffer direct consequences:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Without Supplies:</strong> Each day, every Seeker gains 1 <em>Starvation</em> token.
                        Eating removes 1 token per day.</li>
                    <li><strong>Without Morale:</strong> Each day, every Seeker gains 1 <em>Despair</em> token. Spending
                        1 Morale removes 1 Despair token from all.</li>
                    <li><strong>Without Luck:</strong> The Archivist may apply the <em>Bad Luck</em> column, amplifying
                        negative effects.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Resource Recovery</h4>
                <p>
                    Depleted resources cannot be used until replenished. Recovery is possible through:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rest:</strong> A full rest phase can restore portions of Morale or Luck.</li>
                    <li><strong>Camp:</strong> Establishing a camp allows for resupply, reduced attrition, and partial
                        recovery of resources.</li>
                    <li><strong>Special Items & Abilities:</strong> Some treasures, rituals, or Masteries can instantly
                        restore or enhance resources.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Mismanagement of resources leaves Seekers vulnerable, forcing harsher decisions and
                    exposing them to the Archivist’s generated hazards.

                <p>An <em>Hex</em> is the fundamental unit of exploration in <em>Seeker</em>. Each hex represents a
                    stretch of
                    territory large enough to contain multiple landmarks, resources, and dangers, yet small enough to be
                    crossed
                    within a single stage of the journey. When Seekers reveal a new hex, they are not uncovering every
                    detail of
                    the land, but establishing the broad strokes that define its character. These structural elements
                    give the
                    Archivist and the players a common framework to generate terrain, populate it with features, and
                    shape the
                    challenges of travel.</p>
                <h3>Hex Categories</h3>
                <p>In Seeker, explored territory is divided into two different types of Hexes, each serving a distinct
                    role in pacing and encounter design:</p>

                <ul class="diamond">
                    <li><strong>Primary Hexes</strong> — Fully detailed; meaningful encounters or challenges.</li>
                    <li><strong>Secondary Hexes</strong> — Simplified; passage or narrative pacing.</li>
                </ul>


                <h3>Hex Features</h3>
                <p>The following components define the identity of each hex and guide how it will impact
                    the expedition.</p>

                <table>

                                narrative anchors, or adventure hooks. Landmarks are what make each Hex distinct and

                    Use this loop whenever the party reveals a <em>Primary Hex</em>. The Archivist frames the Hex,
                    generates its hidden
                    characteristics, and presents signals in fiction; the Seekers respond by scouting, spending
                    resources, or accepting
                    hardship. The outcome fixes travel time, risks, and rewards for that Hex. <em>Secondary Hexes</em>
                    skip most details
                    unless the Archivist escalates them to Primary during play.

                <h3>Seekers’ Operations</h3>
                <p>
                    When venturing into unknown territory, Seekers rely on their <em>Exploration Skills</em> and
                    <em>Masteries</em>
                    to shape the outcome of each Hex. The following are not direct actions to be chosen, but rather
                    the common types of effects such abilities can produce. This overview is meant to illustrate how
                    Seekers
                    typically influence the landscape, threats, and opportunities of exploration.
                </p>

                <ul class="diamond">
                    <li><strong>Scout / Reveal:</strong> Learn one hidden characteristic (or narrow it) before
                        committing to action.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soften an Obstacle:</strong> Convert a hard barrier into a slower path or a one-use
                        crossing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Redirect a Danger:</strong> Delay, lure away, or change the trigger window of a threat.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Exploit a Resource:</strong> Improve yield or reduce the time/effort to harvest.</li>
                    <li><strong>Distort Fate (Luck):</strong> Reroll, flip, or downgrade one negative result; cannot be
                        used if Luck is 0.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stabilize / Lockwork:</strong> Lay markers, maps, or sigils that help lock the Hex for
                        future visits.</li>
                </ul>

                <blockquote>
                    <h4>Game Example — Jungle River, Heavy Rain</h4>
                    <p>The party leaves known trails and reveals a <em>Primary Hex</em>.
                        The Archivist chooses <em>Biome: Jungle</em> and rolls in secret:
                        <em>Obstacle:</em> flooded river with unstable banks;
                        <em>Resource:</em> high-canopy fruit and clean rain catch;
                        <em>Danger:</em> jaguar pair stalking the shore;
                        <em>Anomaly:</em> shadows that drift counter to the sun;
                        <em>Special:</em> obsidian waystone etched with solar glyphs;
                        <em>Weather:</em> heavy rain.
                    </p>
                    <p>At a glance the Seekers hear roaring water and see mist above the canopy—clear clues of a major
                        crossing and bad weather.
                        The Navigator spends <em>Morale</em> to <em>Scout</em>, revealing the river as the primary
                        Obstacle. The Tinkerer expends
                        <em>Supplies</em> to rig a rope-span, <em>softening</em> the crossing to a slower but safer
                        ford. The party decides to
                        <em>accept</em> the jaguars unchanged to conserve resources, immediately gaining <strong>+1
                            Luck</strong> (Accepting Hardship).
                    </p>
                    <p>Crossing takes the baseline 1 day (Primary Hex), extended by rain to a grueling pace but without
                        extra mishaps thanks to the
                        rope-span. Near dusk the jaguars test the group—quick, tense exchange; the Seekers fend them off
                        with minimal expenditure,
                        earning <strong>+1 Morale</strong> (Triumph Over Danger). They harvest canopy fruit,
                        replenishing <strong>Supplies</strong>.
                        With daylight fading, they choose <em>not</em> to lock the Hex; on a future return, this area
                        may reset under new rains,
                        new tracks… or stranger shadows.</p>

                <h4>Hex Generation</h4>
                <p>Archivist rolls characteristics once; these determine dangers, anomalies, obstacles, structures, and
                    Weather. No further rolls are needed.</p>

                <h4>Travel Time</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Primary Hex:</strong> At least 1 day to cross; obstacles or harsh conditions may
                        increase travel time or resource cost.</li>
                    <li><strong>Secondary Hex:</strong> Time determined by Archivist.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Locking Hexes</h4>
                <p>The New World is mutable and unstable. Unless Seekers take deliberate actions to “lock” a Hex, it
                    resets once abandoned.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Locking requires time, Skills, or Masteries (e.g., <em>Cartography</em>, <em>Surveying</em>).
                    </li>
                    <li>Locked Hexes remain consistent on revisit.</li>
                    <li>Unlocked Hexes may shift features or biome.</li>
                    <li>Multiple Hexes can be locked if resources allow.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Supplies and Attrition</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Without Supplies:</strong> Each day, every Seeker gains 1 Starvation token. Eating
                        removes 1 token per day.</li>
                    <li><strong>Without Morale:</strong> Each day, every Seeker gains 1 Despair token. Spending 1 Morale
                        removes 1 Despair token from all.</li>
                    <li><strong>Without Luck:</strong> Archivist may apply Bad Luck column for amplified negative
                        effects.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Resource Recovery</h4>
                <p>Resources can be restored via rest, camp, or special items/abilities.</p>

                        Hexes</strong> should contain an Anomaly to maintain the sense of a world transformed by strange
                    forces.</p>

                <p><strong>Specials</strong> are unique discoveries: ruins, sacred sites, indigenous settlements, or
                    long-forgotten relics. Specials give texture and narrative hooks to the exploration.</p>

                    <li><strong>Resource Discovery:</strong> Finding Resources replenishes Supplies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Triumph Over Danger:</strong> Surviving a Danger without major expenditure restores +1
                        Morale.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This cycle ensures the Seekers can continue deeper into the New World, but only if they balance risk
