                </header>
                <p>Exploration in <em>Seeker</em> is not a passive journey, but a structured game of discovery where
                    each
                    step into the unknown reshapes the map. Instead of moving across a pre-drawn landscape, the Seekers
                    reveal
                    one hex at a time, building the New World as they advance. This procedural system ensures that no
                    expedition
                    is ever the same, and that each choice carries weight and consequence.</p>

                <p>The exploration is a contest of intent between the Archivist and the Seekers. The Archivist
                    introduces
                    uncertainty and hardship by generating the terrain, anomalies, and dangers of each new hex. The
                    Seekers,
                    through their skills, masteries, and resources, attempt to mitigate risks, exploit opportunities,
                    and
                    transform a hostile land into one they can traverse and survive. Every revealed hex becomes a
                    strategic
                    battleground between adversity and adaptation.</p>

                <p>This process balances randomness and agency. Dice rolls inject unpredictability, shaping dangers,
                    features,
                    and events; but the Seekers’ decisions—whether to press forward, scout, or retreat—determine how
                    harshly
                    those results impact their journey. The challenge is not simply to endure, but to manage resources,
                    exploit
                    discoveries, and anticipate what lies beyond the next edge of the map.</p>

                <p>At its heart, exploration is a cycle of risk and reward. The Seekers must accept hardship, seize rare
                    opportunities, and endure unexpected dangers. Boldness is rewarded, caution preserves survival, and
                    every
                    hex revealed is another fragment of a living world influenced by Solaria’s presence. This system
                    transforms
                    travel into a tense, evolving narrative where the landscape itself is both adversary and treasure.

                </header>

                <p>Before embarking on an expedition, each Seeker must decide whether to take on a specific role within
                    the party. These roles represent historical functions within real expeditions and grant access to
                    Skills and Masteries that only those roles can employ. The choice of roles defines how the
                    expedition is organized, where leadership lies, and how resources are managed during the journey.
                </p>

                <h3>Assignment Rules</h3>
                <p>The following rules define how roles are assigned within the group:</p>
                <ul class="diamond">
                    <li>Each Seeker may take at most one role.</li>
                    <li>It is not mandatory to cover all available roles.</li>
                    <li>At least one Seeker must be assigned as <strong>Captain</strong>.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Procedure</h3>
                <p>At the start of the expedition, the party decides collectively who fills which role. This decision is
                    locked for the duration of the journey: roles may only be reassigned once the expedition is
                    concluded and the Seekers return to a safe haven.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Before setting out into unknown territory, the group assigns Roles. Isabel chooses Captain, Diego
                        takes Scout, while Rodrigo assumes the role of Quartermaster.</p>

                    <p>During exploration, Diego uses his Scout Skill to automatically learn what <u>Danger</u> lies in
                        the next hex. Later, Rodrigo’s Quartermaster Mastery increases the <u>Supplies</u> found when
                        harvesting by +1. At the expedition’s end, Isabel’s Captain Mastery restores 3 <u>Morale</u>
                        spent during the journey (equal to her Charisma score).</p>
                </blockquote>

                <h3>Roles</h3>
                <p>The following roles provide different
                    ways of interacting with the world:</p>
                <ul class="no-bullet">
                    <li><strong class="highlight">Captain <span style="color: var(--off-white)">•</span> Capitán</strong> — The leader of the expedition. Responsible
                        for discipline, morale, and
                        the ultimate direction of the journey. The Captain embodies authority and vision.</li>
                    <li><strong class="highlight">Quartermaster <span style="color: var(--off-white)">•</span> Furriel</strong> — Oversees supplies, provisions, and
                        the fair distribution of
                        resources. Keeps the group alive by preventing scarcity and mismanagement.</li>
                    <li><strong class="highlight">Scout <span style="color: var(--off-white)">•</span> Explorador</strong> — Guides the party through unknown
                        terrain, identifying dangers and paths
                        ahead. The Scout represents keen senses and survival instincts.</li>
                    <li><strong class="highlight">Chaplain <span style="color: var(--off-white)">•</span> Capellán</strong> Provides spiritual guidance and a moral
                        compass. The Chaplain can
                        inspire hope, faith, or fear, depending on the beliefs carried into the wilderness.</li>
                    <li><strong class="highlight">Chronicler <span style="color: var(--off-white)">•</span> Cronista</strong> — Records the events of the expedition,
                        maps lands, and preserves
                        knowledge for posterity. Their presence ensures discoveries are not lost to memory.</li>
                    <li><strong class="highlight">Navigator <span style="color: var(--off-white)">•</span> Navegante</strong> — Master of the stars, maps, and
                        instruments. The Navigator ensures
                        the group knows where it stands and how to reach its destination.</li>
                    <li><strong class="highlight">Artillerist <span style="color: var(--off-white)">•</span> Artillero</strong> — Maintains and commands the
                        expedition’s weapons, from arquebuses
                        to cannons. The Artillerist embodies firepower and intimidation.</li>
                    <li><strong class="highlight">Interpreter <span style="color: var(--off-white)">•</span> Interprete</strong> — Bridges languages and cultures,
                        allowing parley or deception. The
                        Interpreter is often the thin line between diplomacy and conflict.</li>

                    Exploration is a collective endeavor. The group shares and manages key resources that
                    measure both physical supplies and intangible resilience. Skills and Masteries can
                    affect how efficiently these resources are spent or recovered, but their scarcity
                    always defines the rhythm of an expedition.

                            You can restore <span class="iconize">Supplies</span>
                            by resupplying in settlements, scavenging in the wild, or trading with other groups.
                            Some Skills or Masteries allow you to stretch existing stocks further, improvise
                            substitutes,

                            drawing fate’s attention. Reckless overreliance on
                            <span class="iconize">Luck</span> can quickly drain it, leaving the group at the
                            mercy of cruel destiny.

                <h3>Supplies and Attrition</h3>
<p>
    Exploration constantly drains the expedition’s provisions and stamina. 
    Food, equipment, and mental resilience are finite—and when they run out, the 
    consequences are dire. Three key resources—Supplies, Morale, and Luck—determine 
    whether Seekers endure the wilds or succumb to them.

</ul>

<h4>Resource Recovery</h4>
<p>
    Lost resources cannot be restored simply by resting or waiting; they must be actively sought in the wilderness. 
    Seekers who dedicate time to searching an explored Hex may attempt to recover Supplies, but success is never 
    assured. At best, the expedition secures just enough to offset its losses; at worst, the attempt draws the 
    attention of hidden dangers. 
</p>
<p>
    The Quartermaster plays a crucial role in this process. Through specialized Skills and Masteries, they can guide 
    the expedition more efficiently, improving the chances of finding what is needed and reducing the risks involved. 
    Even so, recovery is uncertain, and survival depends on whether the Seekers can balance their dwindling reserves 
    with the perils of the land.

                <p>An <em>Hex</em> is the fundamental unit of exploration in <em>Seeker</em>. Each hex represents a
                    stretch of
                    territory large enough to contain multiple landmarks, resources, and dangers, yet small enough to be
                    crossed
                    within a single stage of the journey. When Seekers reveal a new hex, they are not uncovering every
                    detail of
                    the land, but establishing the broad strokes that define its character. These structural elements
                    give the
                    Archivist and the players a common framework to generate terrain, populate it with features, and
                    shape the
                    challenges of travel.</p>
                <h3>Hex Categories</h3>
                <p>In Seeker, explored territory is divided into two different types of Hexes, each serving a distinct
                    role in pacing and encounter design:</p>

                <ul class="diamond">
                    <li><strong>Primary Hexes</strong> — Fully detailed; meaningful encounters or challenges.</li>
                    <li><strong>Secondary Hexes</strong> — Simplified; passage or narrative pacing.</li>
                </ul>


                <h3>Hex Features</h3>
                <p>The following components define the identity of each hex and guide how it will impact
                    the expedition.</p>

                                strangeness of the New World, and at least one in four Primary Hexes should contain them

                <p>Secondary Hexes contain only the Biome and the Weather, and are otherwise empty of mechanical
                    characteristics (unless
                    the Archivist chooses to escalate them into Primary Hexes during play).</p>

                    <h3>The New World vs. the Seekers</h3>
                    <p>
    The Archivist’s role is not to hand out safe havens or effortless rewards. Each result they 
    generate should lean toward scarcity, obstacles, or looming threats. An unexplored Hex is not 
    a blank canvas of opportunity but a landscape that actively resists the Seekers’ progress. 
    Dangerous terrain, hostile weather, dwindling forage, or hidden enemies all emerge through 
    the Archivist’s rolls, ensuring that exploration is never trivial. 
</p>
<p>
    Once the Archivist has revealed what lies ahead, the Seekers may intervene to soften or reshape 
    those outcomes. This comes at a cost: altering a threat, bypassing a scarcity, or easing a hazard 
    requires spending precious expedition resources. Supplies, Morale, or even time itself can be 
    consumed in the effort. Such interventions grant agency to the players, allowing them to mitigate 
    the dangers before them, but force difficult choices: is it wiser to preserve the expedition’s 
    reserves and face the challenge unaltered, or to invest now in survival at the risk of future 
    scarcity? 
</p>
<p>
    This dynamic keeps exploration tense and strategic. The Archivist establishes the adversity, 
    while the Seekers decide how much they are willing to sacrifice to bend the wilderness in their 
    favor. The balance between enduring hardships and expending resources defines the rhythm and 
    drama of the journey.

                    Use this loop whenever the party reveals a <em>Primary Hex</em>. The Archivist frames the Hex,
                    generates its hidden
                    characteristics, and presents signals in fiction; the Seekers respond by scouting, spending
                    resources, or accepting
                    hardship. The outcome fixes travel time, risks, and rewards for that Hex. <em>Secondary Hexes</em>
                    skip most details
                    unless the Archivist escalates them to Primary during play.

                <h3>Knowledge & Revelation</h3>
                <p>
                    Archivist rolls and decisions remain hidden by default. Weather and obvious terrain are perceptible;
                    everything
                    else requires scouting,
                    trial, or specific abilities. Some results may be <em>latent</em> (only trigger on camp/search),
                    supporting tension without
                    overloading the moment of entry.
                </p>

                <h3>Seekers’ Operations</h3>
                <p>
                    When venturing into unknown territory, Seekers rely on their <em>Exploration Skills</em> and
                    <em>Masteries</em>
                    to shape the outcome of each Hex. The following are not direct actions to be chosen, but rather
                    the common types of effects such abilities can produce. This overview is meant to illustrate how
                    Seekers
                    typically influence the landscape, threats, and opportunities of exploration.
                </p>

                <ul class="diamond">
                    <li><strong>Scout / Reveal:</strong> Learn one hidden characteristic (or narrow it) before
                        committing to action.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soften an Obstacle:</strong> Convert a hard barrier into a slower path or a one-use
                        crossing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Redirect a Danger:</strong> Delay, lure away, or change the trigger window of a threat.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Exploit a Resource:</strong> Improve yield or reduce the time/effort to harvest.</li>
                    <li><strong>Distort Fate (Luck):</strong> Reroll, flip, or downgrade one negative result; cannot be
                        used if Luck is 0.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stabilize / Lockwork:</strong> Lay markers, maps, or sigils that help lock the Hex for
                        future visits.</li>
                </ul>

                <blockquote>
                    <h4>Game Example — Jungle River, Heavy Rain</h4>
                    <p>The party leaves known trails and reveals a <em>Primary Hex</em>.
                        The Archivist chooses <em>Biome: Jungle</em> and rolls in secret:
                        <em>Obstacle:</em> flooded river with unstable banks;
                        <em>Resource:</em> high-canopy fruit and clean rain catch;
                        <em>Danger:</em> jaguar pair stalking the shore;
                        <em>Anomaly:</em> shadows that drift counter to the sun;
                        <em>Special:</em> obsidian waystone etched with solar glyphs;
                        <em>Weather:</em> heavy rain.
                    </p>
                    <p>At a glance the Seekers hear roaring water and see mist above the canopy—clear clues of a major
                        crossing and bad weather.
                        The Navigator spends <em>Morale</em> to <em>Scout</em>, revealing the river as the primary
                        Obstacle. The Tinkerer expends
                        <em>Supplies</em> to rig a rope-span, <em>softening</em> the crossing to a slower but safer
                        ford. The party decides to
                        <em>accept</em> the jaguars unchanged to conserve resources, immediately gaining <strong>+1
                            Luck</strong> (Accepting Hardship).
                    </p>
                    <p>Crossing takes the baseline 1 day (Primary Hex), extended by rain to a grueling pace but without
                        extra mishaps thanks to the
                        rope-span. Near dusk the jaguars test the group—quick, tense exchange; the Seekers fend them off
                        with minimal expenditure,
                        earning <strong>+1 Morale</strong> (Triumph Over Danger). They harvest canopy fruit,
                        replenishing <strong>Supplies</strong>.
                        With daylight fading, they choose <em>not</em> to lock the Hex; on a future return, this area
                        may reset under new rains,
                        new tracks… or stranger shadows.</p>

                </header>

                <p>
    Venturing into the New World is more than simply moving from one point to another. 
    The wilderness is vast, treacherous, and mutable: each day of travel tests the expedition’s 
    endurance, supplies, and resolve. This chapter explains how Seekers measure progress through 
    Hexes, what it means to secure territory against instability, and how the expedition manages 
    vital resources—Supplies, Morale, and Luck—without which survival becomes increasingly uncertain.
</p>

<h3>Travel Time</h3>
<p>
    Time in the wilderness flows differently—jungles swallow days, mountains turn hours into nights, and storms erase all sense of progress. Each Hex demands its own measure of time.
</p>
<ul class="diamond">
    <li><strong>Primary Hex:</strong> Crossing takes at least <strong class="highlight">one full day</strong>. Difficult terrain, 
        hostile environments, or environmental hazards may extend travel time and increase 
        resource consumption.</li>
    <li><strong>Secondary Hex:</strong> For less detailed areas or regions outside the immediate 
        focus of play, the Archivist determines how long travel requires. This allows the journey 
        to remain narratively paced without unnecessary detail.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Locking Hexes</h3>
<p>
    The New World is unstable, its landscapes mutable under the influence of Solaria. Unless Seekers deliberately take
    action to <em>lock</em> a Hex, everything they have uncovered within it will eventually dissolve back into the
    wilderness. <span class="highlight">An unlocked Hex does not preserve its features</span>: landmarks may vanish, ruins may no longer be found, and
    discovered sites must be rolled again upon the next visit. Only the biome itself remains consistent. 
</p>
<p>
    To prevent this instability, Seekers can spend time and resources to <strong class="highlight">Stabilize a Hex</strong>. This process usually requires
    expertise—such as the use of <em>Cartography</em>, <em>Surveying</em>, or dedicated Masteries—and represents the
    effort of fixing maps, erecting markers, or ritually binding the terrain. Once locked, a Hex becomes a reliable
    anchor: its features, terrain, and landmarks will remain the same whenever the expedition returns.</p>
    <p>Multiple Hexes may be locked during the game, provided the Seekers have the means to secure them.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Accepting Hardship:</strong> If the Seekers accept a negative result without altering
                        it, they gain +1 Luck (representing resilience and fate’s acknowledgment).</li>
                    <li><strong>Resource Discovery:</strong> Finding Resources replenishes Supplies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Triumph Over Danger:</strong> Surviving a Danger without major expenditure restores +1
