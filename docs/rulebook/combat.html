                    In <em>Seeker</em>, combat is a structured interplay of turns, Stances, and strategic interventions.
                    Each participant acts according to clearly defined rules, but the system is designed to encourage
                    interaction beyond the individual turn: combatants can interrupt an opponent’s action, enhance an
                    ally’s ability, modify the outcome of a pending effect, or trigger environmental or status-driven
                    conditions at almost any moment.</p>
                <p>Combat revolves around <strong>Stances</strong>, which determine not only the number of Actions
                    available and the Tags that can be used, but also the order in which participants act. The
                    battlefield is divided into <strong>Units</strong>, providing a flexible spatial framework for
                    movement, range, and positioning, while environmental effects and Difficult Terrain further shape
                    tactical decisions.</p>
                <p>Active defense ensures that every Attack must be met with a counter, and the Escalate mechanic
                    introduces a dynamic layer of risk and resource management. Together, these elements create a system
                    that rewards foresight, timing, and creative use of abilities, transforming each encounter into a
                    puzzle of strategy and adaptability.

                    At the start of a round, each combatant secretly selects a combat <strong>Stance</strong> by placing
                    a card face-down. Standard Stances include Aggressive, Defensive, Evasive, Inquisitive, Mystic,
                    Balanced, and Tactic. </p>
                <p>Each Stance defines the number of available <strong>Actions</strong>, the allowed
                    <strong>Tags</strong>, and the turn priority relative to other Stances.

                                <p>The Aggressive Stance is chosen by those who seize initiative and press the attack
                                    without hesitation. Acting before most opponents, an Aggressive combatant channels
                                    momentum into raw offense, often striking first to disrupt enemy plans. This stance
                                    favors direct assaults, rapid advances, and the decisive use of overwhelming force.
                                    Its strength lies in dictating the pace of battle and punishing hesitation, but it
                                    leaves little room for restraint or defense.</p>

                                <p>The Defensive Stance embodies caution, resilience, and patience. Combatants who adopt
                                    it act later than others, deliberately allowing threats to reveal themselves before
                                    committing to action. In return, they gain superior protection and the ability to
                                    weather assaults that would overwhelm the reckless. This stance is well suited for
                                    guardians, shield-bearers, or those who prioritize survival over speed, anchoring
                                    their allies with stability and endurance.</p>

                                    slowest, it provides a steady rhythm of action and reaction. Combatants in this
                                    stance maintain flexibility, able to blend offense and defense as the situation
                                    demands. While it lacks the extremes of other stances, its strength lies in
                                    reliability and adaptability—always ready, never overcommitted, a foundation upon
                                    which more specialized tactics can pivot.</p>

                                <p>The Mystic Stance channels the strange rhythms of Solaria. Combatants in this stance
                                    act outside the conventional order of battle, often later than most, as they gather
                                    and release energy in deliberate patterns. Their focus is on weaving arcane effects,
                                    bending the flow of combat, and unlocking powers beyond steel and shield. This
                                    stance offers unpredictability and potent utility, but demands patience and
                                    vulnerability before its full force is revealed.</p>

                                <p>The Inquisitive Stance is defined by alertness and adaptability. Those who adopt it
                                    act early, observing the field and probing for weaknesses before committing to
                                    decisive actions. They are well positioned to read the enemy’s intent, respond to
                                    sudden shifts, and exploit emerging opportunities. This stance favors versatility,
                                    granting access to tactics that hinge on perception, investigation, or exploiting
                                    fleeting vulnerabilities.</p>

                                <p>The Tactic Stance is built on foresight, coordination, and control of the
                                    battlefield. Combatants who adopt it rarely seek glory in direct confrontation;
                                    instead, they shape the flow of combat through positioning, support, and calculated
                                    maneuvers. By anticipating enemy movements and amplifying the actions of allies,
                                    they create openings that others can exploit. This stance thrives when battle is
                                    treated as a puzzle to be solved rather than a contest of strength, rewarding
                                    patience, teamwork, and the ability to think several steps ahead.</p>

                                    directly. Combatants who take this stance move with speed and unpredictability,
                                    acting swiftly to reposition or disengage. Their focus is on denying the enemy clean
                                    opportunities to strike, forcing opponents into wasted effort and broken lines.
                                    Though its offensive potential is limited, this stance excels at survival,
                                    infiltration, and tactical withdrawal.</p>

                <p>Once all Stances are revealed, the Archivist calls them in order. Ties between combatants who
                    chose the same Stance are resolved through Agility, mutual agreement, or dice rolls.</p>

                <h3>Special Stances</h3>

                <p>Some abilities and Masteries grant special Stances, such as Berserker or Pathfinder. Special Stances
                    define whether they act before or after a standard Stance and may modify usable Tags or available
                    Actions, adding flexibility and tactical options.</p>

                <h4>Surprise Stance</h4>

                <p>The Surprise Stance applies to combatants caught off guard, whether ambushed, roused from sleep, or
                    attacked by an unexpected enemy. Characters in Surprise Stance act last in the first round and may
                    not perform Actions, but are allowed to use passive abilities and Masteries. After the first round,
                    they may select a new Stance.</p>

                <h3>Movement</h3>
<p>Every combatant may move up to their full Stride value in Units during their turn. This movement represents repositioning on the battlefield, closing distance with enemies, or retreating to safety. Movement can occur at any time within the turn and is not restricted to a single phase. Whether advancing before striking or withdrawing after an exchange, mobility is a constant element of combat.</p>

<h4>Breaking Up Movement</h4>
<p>Movement is not required to be continuous. A combatant may divide their Stride into several segments, inserting Actions between them. For instance, one might advance 2 Units, unleash an attack, and then continue their movement to reposition 4 more Units away. This allows for feints, hit-and-run tactics, and fluid repositioning in response to unfolding events.</p>

                <p>
                    Combat in Seeker is structured around the concept of the Turn, the temporal counterpart to spatial
                    Units. Each Turn represents the smallest indivisible fragment of battle-time, a window in which a
                    single combatant acts, reacts, and repositions within the chaos of conflict.</p>
                <p>The exact length of a Turn is abstract: it can be imagined as only a few seconds in a realistic,
                    grounded encounter, or stretched into half a minute of cinematic flourish in a more dramatic or
                    action-driven scene. The duration is intentionally left flexible so the group can adjust the pacing
                    of combat to match the tone of their story—slowing down for tense duels, or accelerating for fast,
                    cinematic clashes.</p>
                <p>Once every combatant has taken a Turn, the cycle completes and a Round is declared. A Round therefore
                    represents one full sequence of opportunities in which all participants act, observe, and adjust
                    their tactics.</p>
                <p>This cyclical structure is fundamental:</p>
                <ul class="diamond">
                    <li>Turns provide the framework for individual action.</li>
                    <li>Rounds provide the framework for collective pacing, resetting the order of Stances and opening
                        new tactical choices each cycle.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Together, Units and Turns unify space and time in combat. Where Units define how far a combatant can
                    move or reach, Turns define when and in what rhythm these movements and actions occur.
                </p>

                <p>During a turn, a combatant may allocate their Actions to movement, abilities, or environmental interactions, in any sequence permitted by their chosen Stance. The turn is not rigidly segmented but instead flows according to the combatant’s intent, encouraging tactical flexibility.</p>

<h3>Actions</h3>
<p>Actions are the primary way combatants influence the battle. Each Action corresponds to a Tag, such as Attack, Defense, Influence, or Utilize, and may also derive from Masteries, equipment, or environmental features. The number of Actions available depends on the combatant’s Stance, emphasizing its role as the foundation of tactical identity.</p>

<h4>Communication</h4>
<p>Brief communication—shouts, warnings, or simple gestures—may occur freely during a turn. Longer or more deliberate attempts at persuasion, intimidation, or rallying allies require the expenditure of an Influence [Action]. This distinction reinforces the difference between battlefield urgency and deliberate social maneuvering under duress.</p>

<h4>Interaction with Objects</h4>
<p>A combatant may interact with a single object or environmental feature at no Action cost during their turn. This includes actions such as opening a door, drawing a weapon, or picking up a dropped item. More complex interactions, or a second interaction within the same turn, require the expenditure of a Utilize [Action]. Certain artifacts, mechanisms, or magical devices always require a Utilize Action, regardless of context.</p>

<h4>Moving Around Others</h4>
<p>Combatants can pass through the space of an ally, a Tiny creature, or one that is incapacitated without penalty. Passing through the space of any other creature counts as Difficult Terrain, representing the challenge of slipping past an active opponent. A combatant cannot willingly end their movement in another creature’s space unless they are Tiny or significantly larger than their counterpart. Ending movement in a forbidden space forces the combatant into the Prone condition, symbolizing a fall, collision, or loss of balance.</p>

<h4>Inactivity</h4>
<p>A combatant may choose to remain still, forgoing both movement and Actions. This does not mean passivity but deliberate restraint—whether to adopt a defensive stance, conserve resources, or wait for a better opportunity. Choosing inaction can be as powerful as aggression, setting the stage for a decisive response or shaping the rhythm of combat.</p>
