    <p>
        At the beginning of each round, you choose a <strong>Stance</strong>. This determines how many <strong>Actions</strong> you receive, and which <strong>Tags</strong> your character may use for skill-based actions during that round.
    </p>
    <p>
        In <em>Seeker</em>, Actions are both a measure of how many things you can attempt in a round, and a pool of <strong>Action Dice (AD)</strong> that you can commit when performing high-stakes actions. The way you roll depends on the type of action:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Standard Actions:</strong> When attempting an action against the environment (e.g., climbing, sneaking, researching), you roll a number of <strong>Action Dice</strong> equal to your relevant Aptitude. Any result of <code>5</code> or <code>6</code> counts as a <em>success</em>. The number of <strong>Risk Dice</strong> added is determined by the GM, based on danger or unpredictability.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Opposed Actions:</strong> When acting against another character (e.g., attacking, defending, deceiving, grappling), both parties spend Actions as <strong>Action Dice</strong>. Each rolls their committed dice. The one who rolls the most <code>6</code>s wins the contest. If tied, the defender prevails.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Choosing the right Stance is not just about what you want to do — it's also about how well you can defend yourself, control the initiative, or respond to your enemies. Some Stances don't allow defense at all. Others limit your offensive output. Every choice has weight.
