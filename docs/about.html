          <p><strong>To the brave and the curious,</strong></p>
          <p>
            I write you these words not as a scholar speaking to his peers, but as a man who has seen too much to remain
            silent and yet too little to claim certainty.
            My name, for now, shall be <strong>Alonso de Luna</strong>. It is not the name written on my passport, but
            it is the one I have chosen to protect those close to me ‚Äî and perhaps also to protect what little remains
            of my peace.
          </p>

          <p>
            I come from a family whose name once opened doors in <em>Madrid</em>, <em>Sevilla</em>, even <em>Lima</em>,
            in the days when the world was still being drawn on parchment.
            Among old documents, family relics, and items that nobody had touched for generations, I found a fragment.
            It was not large, but it had a weight I cannot describe.
            Encased in dark volcanic glass, it held the faint trace of ink and salt, and something else. <em>Una
              presencia.</em>
          </p>

          <p>
            From that moment, I could not rest. I began a journey, not just through places, but through meanings.
            The kind of path that does not lead forward, but downward, like a well with no bottom.
            From forgotten libraries to convents where the books are kept behind iron bars, I followed the signs until
            Rome, where the final door opened, not to light, but to a deeper darkness.
          </p>

          <p>
            Inside the Secret Archives, in a section unmarked and almost erased from memory, I found documents that do
            not belong to the history we are taught.
            Letters from men who never returned. Sketches of cities not made by hands. Accounts of voices in the forest,
            and maps that shift when the candlelight flickers.
            Things that our world has chosen not to remember ‚Äî or perhaps, has been told to forget.
          </p>

          <p>
            It became clear to me that I could not publish these findings in any academic journal. I do not have
            powerful friends. I am just a man who followed what he believed to be true.
            So I decided to hide my research inside a game. Not because it is a joke, but because games, like dreams,
            are the only places where the truth can still disguise itself and survive.
          </p>

          <p>
            <em>Seeker</em> is the result of this decision. It is not fantasy, although it may appear so at first.
            It is a reconstruction, incomplete and fragile, based on the real materials I was able to collect.
            Some parts I had to invent, not to deceive, but to fill the silence left by time ‚Äî the <em>silencio
              antiguo</em> that still surrounds these testimonies.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you choose to read it, or to play it, I ask you only one thing: pay attention.
            Sometimes, between one rule and the next, you may find something that does not belong entirely to fiction.
          </p>

          <p>
            And if you do‚Ä¶ <em>por favor</em>, do not look away too quickly.
          </p>

    <em>Seeker</em> unfolds during the <strong>Age of Discovery</strong>, a time set in motion by the fateful year
    <strong>1492</strong>, when European empires began reshaping the world through exploration, conquest, and
    colonization.
    Many of the names are familiar ‚Äî the ships, the cities, the flags. But in this version of history, the conquest of the
    Americas unearthed <em>ancient powers</em>. It stirred forces that had long been hidden. <strong>And it silenced
      voices that once held the keys to a very different kind of truth</strong>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The Americas were never a blank slate. Long before European arrival, they were home to civilizations, mysteries, and
    forces <strong>older and more complex than what colonizers could understand</strong> ‚Äî and far more powerful than they
    could ever control.
    The creatures, curses, and deities in Seeker are not just fantasy. They‚Äôre <strong>echoes of a past too
      strange</strong> ‚Äî and too
    unsettling ‚Äî <strong>to be told plainly</strong>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This project approaches history not with romaticism, but with care. It doesn‚Äôt glorify conquest or pretend to be
    neutral. The European powers in Seeker are not noble heroes ‚Äî they‚Äôre <strong>invaders and opportunists</strong>. And
    indigenous peoples are
    not simply victims, nor a single voice. They are <strong>sovereign, complex, and often unknowable</strong>, resisting
    both domination and simplification.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We don‚Äôt speak for any culture. Instead, we aim to <strong>remind players that history still speaks ‚Äî even through
      horror</strong>.
    The violence of the colonial era isn‚Äôt just background. It‚Äôs a wound that shaped the world ‚Äî and it hasn‚Äôt fully
    healed.
    Seeker invites players to face that truth, not to rewrite it, but to ask what was lost‚Ä¶ and what might still be
    remembered.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This game is a work of narrative responsibility. It was built with research, care, and the belief that speculative
    storytelling can reveal truths that history books sometimes overlook. If you choose to play in this world,
    <em>you carry part of that responsibility too</em>.

        <p>
          The world of <em>Seeker</em> is shaped by a blend of modern tools and old obsessions.
          While the core of the project lives in <strong>plain text and version control</strong>,
          its soul is scattered across <em>notebooks, dream fragments, and forgotten books</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of the writing and development takes place in <strong>Visual Studio Code</strong>,
          using <strong>GitHub</strong> to manage and publish updates.
          The content is refined with <strong>ChatGPT</strong> or <strong>Gemini</strong> to improve form, clarity, and
          public presentation. Before publication and playtesting, rules and concepts undergo multiple simulation cycles
          using AI to evaluate their mechanics and interactions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Visual elements, including maps, symbols, and page textures,
          are crafted with <strong>Adobe Photoshop</strong> and <strong>Illustrator</strong>,
          though always with a <em>hand-drawn, imperfect feel</em>.
          Wherever possible, digital tools are bent to serve the tone ‚Äî
          not clean, not corporate, but <em>cracked, raw, and a little wrong</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for inspirations: <em>Seeker</em> owes much to the speculative weirdness of authors like
          <strong>Gene Wolfe</strong>, <strong>Cormac McCarthy</strong>, <strong>Dan Brown</strong>, and <strong>Umberto Eco</strong>,
          as well as TTRPGs like <strong>Trophy Dark</strong>, <strong>M√∂rk Borg</strong>,
          <strong>Blades in the Dark</strong>, <strong>Dungeons & Dragons</strong>, and <strong>Into the Odd</strong>.
          But above all, it draws from <strong>real history</strong> ‚Äî the letters of conquistadors,
          the accounts of friars, the codices of surviving cultures ‚Äî and the <em>gaps between them</em>.
