          <p><strong>To the brave and the curious,</strong></p>
          <p>
            I write you these words not as a scholar speaking to his peers, but as a man who has seen too much to remain
            silent and yet too little to claim certainty.
            My name, for now, shall be <strong>Alonso de Luna</strong>. It is not the name written on my passport, but
            it is the one I have chosen to protect those close to me ‚Äî and perhaps also to protect what little remains
            of my peace.
          </p>

          <p>
            I come from a family whose name once opened doors in <em>Madrid</em>, <em>Sevilla</em>, even <em>Lima</em>,
            in the days when the world was still being drawn on parchment.
            Among old documents, family relics, and items that nobody had touched for generations, I found a fragment.
            It was not large, but it had a weight I cannot describe.
            Encased in dark volcanic glass, it held the faint trace of ink and salt, and something else. <em>Una
              presencia.</em>
          </p>

          <p>
            From that moment, I could not rest. I began a journey, not just through places, but through meanings.
            The kind of path that does not lead forward, but downward, like a well with no bottom.
            From forgotten libraries to convents where the books are kept behind iron bars, I followed the signs until
            Rome, where the final door opened, not to light, but to a deeper darkness.
          </p>

          <p>
            Inside the Secret Archives, in a section unmarked and almost erased from memory, I found documents that do
            not belong to the history we are taught.
            Letters from men who never returned. Sketches of cities not made by hands. Accounts of voices in the forest,
            and maps that shift when the candlelight flickers.
            Things that our world has chosen not to remember ‚Äî or perhaps, has been told to forget.
          </p>

          <p>
            It became clear to me that I could not publish these findings in any academic journal. I do not have
            powerful friends. I am just a man who followed what he believed to be true.
            So I decided to hide my research inside a game. Not because it is a joke, but because games, like dreams,
            are the only places where the truth can still disguise itself and survive.
          </p>

          <p>
            <em>Seeker</em> is the result of this decision. It is not fantasy, although it may appear so at first.
            It is a reconstruction, incomplete and fragile, based on the real materials I was able to collect.
            Some parts I had to invent, not to deceive, but to fill the silence left by time ‚Äî the <em>silencio
              antiguo</em> that still surrounds these testimonies.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you choose to read it, or to play it, I ask you only one thing: pay attention.
            Sometimes, between one rule and the next, you may find something that does not belong entirely to fiction.
          </p>

          <p>
            And if you do‚Ä¶ <em>por favor</em>, do not look away too quickly.
          </p>

          <p style="margin-top:2rem;text-align: end;">

      </h2>
      <p class="section-description" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
        Seeker is a tabletop roleplaying game of forbidden power, colonial secrets, and arcane exploration.
        It does not reinvent history ‚Äî it reveals what was hidden beneath it. Set during the first voyages
        to the New World, the game chronicles a world forever altered by contact with ancient forces and
        unnatural phenomena.</p>

      <p>This section introduces the essential ideas and structure of the game through a brief FAQ ‚Äî a tool
        for new players, and a primer for what lies beyond the veil.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>The following material is based on private research conducted between 2017 and 2024, drawing from
          restricted
          documents preserved within the Secret Vatican Archives. The contents suggest the existence of
          early expeditions that encountered phenomena
          unrecorded in
          any official history.</p>
        <p>For reasons of personal safety, I publish this under the name <em>Alonso
            de Luna</em>.
        </p>
        <p class="footer">‚Äî A. de L.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h3>Who are the Seekers?</h3>
      <p>The Seekers (<em>Buscadores</em> in Spanish) are the player characters ‚Äî field agents operating under
        a covert mandate to <strong>investigate unexplained
          phenomena</strong>, <strong>retrieve arcane relics</strong>, and <strong>neutralize emerging
          threats</strong> tied to the expansion into the New World.</p>

      <p>Officially, <em>they do not exist.</em></p>

      <p>The order of the Seekers was founded in secret in the winter of 1491, as a clandestine alliance
        between Queen
        <strong>Isabella of Castile</strong> and <strong>Henry VII of England</strong>. Alarmed by early
        reports from explorers and missionaries ‚Äî whispers of
        bleeding idols, unkillable beasts, and sacrificial magic ‚Äî the two monarchs agreed to form a hidden
        commission
        beyond the reach of Church or Crown.
      </p>

      <p>Operating under codenames and false commissions, these agents traveled alongside conquistadors,
        chroniclers, and
        traders ‚Äî often disguised as naturalists, theologians, cartographers, or members of the clergy.</p>

      <p>Some among them were names we know today: painters, inventors, navigators, and philosophers whose
        public lives
        masked their true missions. The works they left behind, such as maps, journals, altarpieces, even
        mechanical devices,
        contain traces of what they encountered. But the full truth was buried, redacted, or sealed by the
        founding compact.</p>

      <p>The Seekers are the custodians of that hidden war ‚Äî a war not for land, but for reality itself.</p>

      <p>As a player, you take on the role of one such Seeker. Whether driven by faith, science, greed, guilt,
        or curiosity,
        you will confront forces that defy reason... and return changed, if you return at all.</p>

      <h3>What is the setting of Seeker?</h3>
      <p>The Age of Discovery has begun. The world has not merely expanded ‚Äî <em><strong>it has
            ruptured</strong></em>.</p>
      <p>The jungles breathe. The sea sings. Ancient temples bleed. What began as conquest has become contact
        with something
        older, deeper, and inhuman.</p>

      <p>The story begins in 1492, with the first landfall of Columbus‚Äôs expedition. Though
        official records
        speak only of gold, spice, and fertile land, those who returned from the voyage whispered of
        stranger things.
        Several crewmen fell ill within weeks of disembarkation, afflicted with fevers that twisted flesh
        and mind alike.
        Some grew ravenous, mutated, unrecognizable. Their existence was denied, their remains destroyed,
        their names
        erased.</p>

      <img src="/assets/images/webp/mercator-world-map.webp" class="map">

      <p>In the years that followed, new expeditions uncovered impossible sights: native civilizations that
        harnessed blood
        rituals to bend reality; cities of stone and obsidian raised without tools or scaffolding; pyramids
        whose
        construction modern scholars still cannot explain. The land itself responded with hostility
        reshaping, collapsing,
        resisting. Soil turned black. Rivers reversed. Plants fed on bone. It was as if the very earth
        rejected the presence
        of foreign bodies.</p>

      <p>These events, swiftly concealed by the Crown of Castile, attracted the attention of powerful
        interests. Queen
        Isabella and Henry Tudor saw in them not blasphemy, but opportunity: a means to dominate the world
        through secret
        knowledge. The Vatican, however, interpreted these signs as clear evidence of infernal
        contamination, and moved to
        eradicate them at the root.</p>

      <p>Thus began a hidden conflict: not between nations, but between visions of truth. A race for control
        of the arcane,
        of the unknown, of the soul of the New World. The age of empires was not built on spice and silver
        alone ‚Äî it was
        built on secrecy, sacrifice, and the silence of those who knew too much.</p>

      <h3>What makes Seeker different from other TTRPGs?</h3>
      <p>Seeker reimagines the core of tabletop roleplaying by emphasizing narrative risk, player intent, and
        a world that pushes back. Its systems are tightly interwoven to support tense exploration,
        meaningful choices, and escalating consequences.</p>

        <div class="feature-desc">
          <h4>No Archetypes</h4>
          <p>Seeker breaks away from traditional roleplaying
            templates. There are
            no classes, races, spell slots, or fixed
            archetypes. Instead of locking characters into predefined paths, Seeker lets them grow
            dynamically
            across three
            Tracks ‚Äî <strong>Combat</strong>, <strong>Exploration</strong>, and <strong>Social</strong>
            ‚Äî by
            earning experience and investing it into modular <strong>Skills</strong> and
            <strong>Masteries</strong>.
            Each ability can be further modified through Augmentations, allowing players to shape truly
            unique
            characters
            tailored to their playstyle and story arc.

            dice: <strong>Action</strong>, which determine success, and <strong>Risk</strong>, which
            introduce
            complications. This framework allows for

            <em>‚Äúsuccess with complication‚Äù</em> or <em>‚Äúfailure
              with benefit.‚Äù</em> It encourages drama, tension, and consequence while
            <strong>minimizing math
              at the table</strong>. Rolls are clean,

            <span class="tag">Toxic</span>, or <span class="tag">Defense</span> define
            how abilities interact ‚Äî skills sharing a

            emergent
            gameplay with fewer
            words and clearer logic: rather than repeating complex rules, a single Tag description
            applies

          <h4>Strategic Combat System</h4>
          <p>Combat in Seeker emphasizes tactical
            interplay and intent.
            There is no random initiative ‚Äî instead, each character
            secretly selects a <strong>Stance</strong> at the start of the round. Stances
            <strong>determine initiative order, how many
              actions can be
              taken, and what kinds of Tags are allowed</strong> (e.g., Aggressive allows only Attack,
            Maneuver, and
            Strike). The system
            encourages coordination: characters can interact mid-action, exploit enemy vulnerabilities,
            and
            prepare combos
            across turns. Enemies often have multiple combat phases, requiring players to <strong>shift
              tactics or
              expose weaknesses</strong> to
            succeed. Defense is structured into three layers ‚Äî <strong>Guard, Armor, and Health</strong>
            ‚Äî each with its own
            tactical purpose and
            cost.

          <p>Beneath it all, Seeker is not just a
            tactical or narrative
            game ‚Äî it is a game of tension. Whether through the Risk
            Dice, the Polarity mechanic (which rewards or punishes actions based on your character‚Äôs
            moral arc),
            or the design

      </div>

      <h3>More Information</h3>
      <h4>‚∏∫ Is there a magic system?</h4>
      <p>Not in the traditional sense. Magic in Seeker is rare, corrupting, and narrative-driven. It appears
        in blood
        rituals, cursed relics, sacred geometries, and impossible phenomena. It cannot be mastered ‚Äî only
        endured, resisted,
        or unleashed.</p>

      <h4>‚∏∫ What kind of characters can I play?</h4>
      <p>Anything from a hardened conquistador or ship surgeon, to a disillusioned priest or runaway monk, to
        a heretical
        astronomer or syncretic sorcerer. Your character is defined by their Aptitudes and the Talents they
        acquire through
        play.</p>

      <h4>‚∏∫ What kind of gameplay should I expect?</h4>
      <p>Exploration, investigation, negotiation, and high-risk conflict. You‚Äôll chart unknown territories,
        interpret omens,
        face spiritual afflictions, and make dangerous decisions. The game supports both tactical challenges
        and dramatic
        storytelling.</p>

      <h4>‚∏∫ Is Seeker a horror game?</h4>
      <p>It contains horror, but is not limited to it. The tone is often uncanny, oppressive, and morally
        ambiguous. Fear
        comes not only from the unknown, but from the choices the characters must make ‚Äî and what those
        choices cost them.</p>

      <h4>‚∏∫ Do I need to know history to play?</h4>
      <p>No. Seeker uses history as a scaffold, not a requirement. It reimagines events through the lens of
        dark fantasy and
        myth, inviting creative freedom without demanding academic precision.</p>

      <h4>‚∏∫ Is this game respectful of real-world cultures?</h4>
      <p>The civilizations encountered in the New World are unlike anything known to European chroniclers.
        Though echoes of
        real-world myths and cultures may be felt, these societies have no direct analogue in our own
        history ‚Äî their
        mysteries remain wholly their own.</p>

          <em>Seeker</em> unfolds during the <strong>Age of Discovery</strong>, a time set in motion by the fateful year
          <strong>1492</strong>, when European empires began reshaping the world through exploration, conquest, and
          colonization.
          Many of the names are familiar ‚Äî the ships, the cities, the flags. But in this version of history, the
          conquest of the
          Americas unearthed <em>ancient powers</em>. It stirred forces that had long been hidden. <strong>And it
            silenced
            voices that once held the keys to a very different kind of truth</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Americas were never a blank slate. Long before European arrival, they were home to civilizations,
          mysteries, and
          forces <strong>older and more complex than what colonizers could understand</strong> ‚Äî and far more powerful
          than they
          could ever control.
          The creatures, curses, and deities in Seeker are not just fantasy. They‚Äôre <strong>echoes of a past too
            strange</strong> ‚Äî and too
          unsettling ‚Äî <strong>to be told plainly</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          This project approaches history not with romaticism, but with care. It doesn‚Äôt glorify conquest or pretend to
          be
          neutral. The European powers in Seeker are not noble heroes ‚Äî they‚Äôre <strong>invaders and
            opportunists</strong>. And
          indigenous peoples are
          not simply victims, nor a single voice. They are <strong>sovereign, complex, and often unknowable</strong>,
          resisting
          both domination and simplification.
        </p>

        <p>
          We don‚Äôt speak for any culture. Instead, we aim to <strong>remind players that history still speaks ‚Äî even
            through
            horror</strong>.
          The violence of the colonial era isn‚Äôt just background. It‚Äôs a wound that shaped the world ‚Äî and it hasn‚Äôt
          fully
          healed.
          Seeker invites players to face that truth, not to rewrite it, but to ask what was lost‚Ä¶ and what might still
          be
          remembered.
        </p>

        <p>
          This game is a work of narrative responsibility. It was built with research, care, and the belief that
          speculative
          storytelling can reveal truths that history books sometimes overlook. If you choose to play in this world,
          <em>you carry part of that responsibility too</em>.

        <p>
          The world of <em>Seeker</em> is shaped by a blend of modern tools and old obsessions.
          While the core of the project lives in <strong>plain text and version control</strong>,
          its soul is scattered across <em>notebooks, dream fragments, and forgotten books</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of the writing and development takes place in <strong>Visual Studio Code</strong>,
          using <strong>GitHub</strong> to manage and publish updates.
          The content is refined with <strong>ChatGPT</strong> or <strong>Gemini</strong> to improve form, clarity, and
          public presentation. Before publication and playtesting, rules and concepts undergo multiple simulation cycles
          using AI to evaluate their mechanics and interactions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Visual elements, including maps, symbols, and page textures,
          are crafted with <strong>Adobe Photoshop</strong> and <strong>Illustrator</strong>,
          though always with a <em>hand-drawn, imperfect feel</em>.
          Wherever possible, digital tools are bent to serve the tone ‚Äî
          not clean, not corporate, but <em>cracked, raw, and a little wrong</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for inspirations: <em>Seeker</em> owes much to the speculative weirdness of authors like
          <strong>Gene Wolfe</strong>, <strong>Cormac McCarthy</strong>, <strong>Dan Brown</strong>, and <strong>Umberto
            Eco</strong>,
          as well as TTRPGs like <strong>Trophy Dark</strong>, <strong>M√∂rk Borg</strong>,
          <strong>Blades in the Dark</strong>, <strong>Dungeons & Dragons</strong>, and <strong>Into the Odd</strong>.
          But above all, it draws from <strong>real history</strong> ‚Äî the letters of conquistadors,
          the accounts of friars, the codices of surviving cultures ‚Äî and the <em>gaps between them</em>.
