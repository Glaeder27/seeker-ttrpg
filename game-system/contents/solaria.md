# Solaria

### The Lost Science of the Cosmic Sun

## What is Solaria

Solaria is a form of cosmic energy discovered and harnessed by Mesoamerican civilizations, most notably the Tenochca (Aztecs), through a sophisticated system of engineering.

Originally, the Aztecs called it **Tonatiuh**, meaning “Movement of the Sun,” referring to the full spectrum of cosmic energy, including both bright (light, heat, illumination) and void (darkness, cold, entropy) forces. To conceal the existence of this energy, Seekers told Europeans that Tonatiuh was a deity worshiped by the natives.

> “What you call sorcery is but the science of antiquity — a science our instruments are not yet refined enough to discern.”

## Nomenclature

* **Solaria** — European term derived from Tonatiuh; used as the primary name. Encompasses the full duality of cosmic energy.
* **Tonatiuh** — Aztec term meaning “Movement of the Sun”; refers to the total cosmic energy including both bright and void aspects.
* Other terms (e.g., **Xiuhtlalpan**, **Æther Solis**) appear in certain manuscripts but are secondary.

## Duality of Energy: Bright and Void

Solaria manifests as a dual energy system:

* **Bright** — associated with sunlight, heat, life, and illumination.
* **Void** — associated with darkness, cold, entropy, and the cosmic vacuum.

Being a cosmically pervasive energy, Solaria flows through all matter and phenomena: not only the Sun and planets, but also stars, galaxies, black holes, and dark matter. While Aztecs understood this as a single Tonatiuh, European alchemists and scholars (influenced by Christianity) separated it conceptually. Void energy was considered occult, negative, or demonic, so the Papal Inquisitors (counterparts to Seekers) were forbidden from using it.

## Why Solaria is active only in the New World

Solaria flows through a continent-spanning energy network constructed by ancient civilizations. European scholars mistook the infrastructure for ceremonial architecture, but it is a **precision system of energy capture, storage, and transmission**.

### Pyramid — Energy Capture

Solar rays, planetary alignments, and starlight converge upon pyramid tops. **Bright energy** concentrates at temple apexes — the *Descent of the Sun Serpent*.

### Cenote — Energy Storage

Cenotes act as capacitors for Solaria. Energy manifests as radiant light or intense void currents; touching charged waters can be lethal.

### Ley Lines — Transmission

Energy flows through conductive sacred veins. Lines transmit both bright and void energy across the landscape, creating a continuous cosmic circuit.

### Monuments — Distribution Nodes

Obelisks and stelae act as field repeaters, stabilizing access to bright and void energy alike.

## How Does Solaria Work

Solaria is a continuous cosmic field that permeates all matter in the New World, similar to an electromagnetic field. To produce tangible effects, the field must be **modulated** according to precise patterns — formulas that disturb the field locally.

### Modulation Mechanisms

1. **Reactive Materials** — Sacred substances such as obsidian, cenote water, and gold react to Solaria. Their sacredness originates from their natural responsiveness, enabling effects. They can be used as artifacts or incorporated into tattoos, body paint, or other inscriptions on practitioners to enhance or enable their ability to manipulate Solaria.
2. **Spatial and Temporal Arrangement** — Moving reactive materials through space and time in specific patterns disturbs the field at targeted points, producing desired phenomena.

#### Interfacing with Solaria

To “become part of the circuit” of Solaria and interact with the field, human conduits are required:

* **Mesoamerican Tradition: Tlāltikpak** — The Aztecs enhanced their natural biological affinity (due to blood rich in iron and reactive elements) by painting glyphs and cosmic geometries onto their skin with metallic pigments. These glyphs, often arranged along muscles and joints, acted as conductive circuits activated during rituals at energy nodes.
* **European Tradition: Imprinta Sigillata** — Inspired by Aztec practices, European alchemists developed their own counterpart. Alchemical sigils etched or painted onto flesh with oxidized gold, verdigris copper, or burnished iron function as symbolic keys. Unlike the Aztec method, these require careful celestial alignment and personal sacrifice.

Blood remained central: Aztecs used sacrificial blood to distill and redistribute Solaria’s potency, while Europeans experimented with transfusions and alchemical distillations to mimic the effect.

### Who Can Use Solaria

Anyone within the active Solaria field generated by the ancient network and possessing reactive materials (either as artifacts or within their body) can use Solaria, provided they know the proper techniques.

## Effects of Solaria

These are the core building blocks of Solaria’s effects. Many practical uses involve **combinations** of two or more effects, either **in parallel** (occurring simultaneously) or **in series** (occurring sequentially), following principles similar to electrical circuits.

> When the field returns to equilibrium, a physical phenomenon occurs. Greater disturbances produce stronger effects.

Core effects include:

* **Gravitation** — manipulation of gravitational forces for levitation, attraction, or propulsion.
* **Flare** — instantaneous bursts of energy, light, or void explosions.
* **Beam** — sustained energy rays or currents, luminous or void.
* **Mutation** — permanent alteration of matter or living beings, enhancing or damaging.
* **Resonance** — temporary disturbance of an object or being, weakening or confusing without permanent damage.

**Color code & aesthetics:**

* Bright phenomena: **yellow/golden**, accompanied by sparks, glowing filaments, flashes, and bursts of heat.
* Void phenomena: **purple/blue-black**, with black sparks, ice crystals, violet lightning, greenish flashes, and cold gusts.
* **Sight** — Radiant glare: golden flares or purple void pulses, sparks, glowing filaments, bursts of light.
* **Touch** — Thermal / Cold bloom: warmth or chilling vacuum precedes activation.
* **Sound** — Resonance: low hum or crackle of energized field.
* **Smell** — Ionized air: sun-baked stone or ozone-rich vacuum.

**Warnings:** Incorrect or imprecise modulation can lead to catastrophic or lethal effects.

## Scientific Hypotheses

* Over the centuries, various scientists risked uncovering Solaria despite the Seekers and Papacy erasing nearly all traces. The most striking case was **Nikola Tesla**, who, inspired by Spanish diaries describing pyramids channeling solar energy, developed his *World Wireless System*.
* Through the **Imprinta Sigillata**, European alchemy advanced dramatically. By interfacing with Solaria, alchemists began to grasp the structure of matter itself. They reportedly discovered methods to **cure illnesses** and even to **transmute base metals into gold**.
