# What is Seeker?
Seeker is a tabletop roleplaying game of forbidden power, colonial secrets, and arcane exploration. Set in an alternate 1492, it reimagines the Age of Discovery as the moment the world brushed against the unfathomable — and tore open the veil that held it back.

Players become Seekers and Buscadores, agents of the crowns of England and Castile, secretly entrusted by Henry VII and Queen Isabella to uncover the truth behind the New World’s terrifying wonders. What was meant to be a path to gold and dominion has become a plunge into the unknown. The jungles are alive with energies not of this earth. Temples bleed. Sacrifices awaken forces that defy reason. And beneath it all, something ancient watches, waiting.

Magic in Seeker is not a tool — it is a curse, a temptation, a weapon. European empires seek to harness it. The native powers wield it with brutal ritual. The Church demands its annihilation. In this fractured theatre, the Seekers walk a tightrope between discovery and damnation.

Unlike other TTRPGs, Seeker is built on total character freedom. There are no classes or rigid roles: every explorer grows uniquely, unlocking talents through three evolving paths — Combat, Exploration, and Social. Characters customize abilities using an intuitive tag-based augmentation system, allowing for deep mechanical creativity and unexpected synergy.

Seeker blends tactical combat, investigative tension, and narrative consequence. A character weak in battle may become a vital negotiator, a mystic scholar, or a saboteur. But every expedition carries a price — and those who enter the New World seldom return untouched.

A mission might be simple: destroy a temple before the ritual completes. But a campaign might reach toward darker ends: silencing Montezuma, decoding the secrets of a sunken pyramid, or choosing between the will of the Queen and the survival of the world.

In the end, Seeker is not just a game of conquest or survival. It is a question:

Will you change the New World — or will it change you?

# Dice Engine - Twin Coil System
## Core Concept

The Twin Coil System is a lightweight, modular dice‑resolution mechanic that produces non‑binary outcomes by balancing a character’s intent against the risk inherent in the world.

Every roll intertwines two opposing forces:
| Coil | Dice Name | What it Represents |
| Active Coil |	Action Dice | The effort, skill, or will a character invests to achieve a goal. |
| Passive Coil | Risk Dice | The danger, resistance, or chaos that might disrupt the action. |

These forces do not cancel each other; they combine to generate richly textured results.

## Dice Structure

In the Twin Coil System, all actions are resolved using standard six-sided dice (d6). These are divided into two distinct pools: Action Dice, representing the character’s proactive effort, and Risk Dice, representing external threats and complications.

### Rolling Dice

To resolve an action, the player and GM each build their respective dice pools. The number of dice reflects both the character's capability and the environmental risk.

- Build the pools
    - The player rolls a number of Action Dice equal to their relevant attribute, skill, or trait.
    - The GM rolls a number of Risk Dice equal to the situation’s threat level.
- Roll simultaneously.
- Interpret Results:
    - Action Dice shows 5 6 → Success
    - Risk Dice shows 6 → Complication

    Successes and Complications are independent. A roll may succeed and spawn complications.

### Outcome Matrix

The Twin Coil System allows for rich narrative possibilities by moving beyond simple pass/fail mechanics. Each action can result in one of four core outcomes:

Risk ❌ + Action ❌ → Failure: The attempt fails cleanly.

Risk ✔ + Action ❌ → Failure + Complication: The attempt fails and a new problem emerges.

Risk ❌ + Action ✔ → Success: The attempt succeeds with no downside.

Risk ✔ + Action ✔ → Success + Complication: The attempt succeeds, but something else goes wrong.

These four outcomes — Failure, Success, Failure + Complication, and Success + Complication — form the narrative backbone of the Twin Coil System. They encourage GMs and players alike to think beyond binary results and to embrace the full spectrum of possibility: from clean victories to risky gambles that pay off with a price.

By decoupling success from safety, the system ensures that every roll matters, even — and especially — when things go sideways.

# Seeker's Ability Scores: Aptitudes

In Seeker, every meaningful action a character takes — whether leaping over a chasm, resisting an ancient curse, or negotiating with a wary native tribe — is rooted in one of their core Aptitudes.

Aptitudes represent the essential physical, mental, and social capabilities of a Seeker. Rather than relying on long lists of predefined skills, Seeker distills character ability into nine core attributes, each one reflecting a broad aspect of how a character interacts with the world.

Each action, challenge, or conflict in the game is framed through one or more Aptitudes. Whether a character excels through brute Force, clever improvisation, or careful observation, their Aptitudes define how they attempt to shape their surroundings — and how well they are likely to succeed.

This chapter explains what the Aptitudes are, how they are used during play, how characters select their values at creation, and how they interact with the core resolution system.

## The Nine Aptitudes

In Seeker, each Aptitude is normally rated from 1 (basic competence) to 5 (extraordinary mastery).

Minimum scores represent the lower end of capable human performance. A Seeker with Strength 1 is not weak — they are simply not exceptional. Maximum scores (4 and 5) are attainable through natural character progression and reflect the pinnacle of human potential — sometimes already bordering on the extraordinary. Values beyond 5, while not normally available, may be temporarily or permanently achieved through Masteries, powerful equipment, arcane influence, or narrative effects.

Certain NPCs or supernatural beings may ignore these limits entirely, embodying truly alien or divine forces. The rules intentionally allow flexibility for how Aptitude values are interpreted and presented.

The following section breaks down each of the nine Aptitudes individually, offering guidance on when to apply them in play and how they shape a Seeker’s approach to challenges. Grouped into Combat, Exploration, and Social categories, these traits define the core capacities of every adventurer — from raw strength and sharp wit to charm, intuition, and adaptability.

### Combat Aptitudes
These aptitudes reflect your character's physical prowess, ability to engage in direct conflict, and resilience in dangerous situations. They are crucial for overcoming physical challenges and confronting threats head-on.

#### Strength
Raw physical power, brute force, and the capacity to lift, shove, strike, or break through obstacles using over­whelm­ing strength and effort.

#### Agility
Quick reflexes, balance, speed, coordination, and precise control over fine motor movements — especially under pressure or in dynamic environments.

#### Vigor
Stamina, resilience, and physical durability — the ability to endure pain, resist harm, and keep going despite exhaustion, illness, or injury.

### Exploration Aptitudes
These aptitudes define your character's capacity for discovery, problem-solving, and interacting with the environment. They are essential for navigating unknown territories, understanding ancient lore, and utilizing resources effectively.

#### Perception
Awareness, observation skills, and the ability to notice details, detect hidden dangers, or sense subtle changes in the environment.

#### Intellect
Logic, memory, reasoning, and the capacity to analyze information, solve problems, and un­der­stand complex or abstract concepts.

#### Adaptability
Improvisation, creativity under pressure, and the ability to react quickly and re­source­fully to un­ex­pect­ed situations or unfamiliar tools.

### Social Aptitudes
These aptitudes govern your character's ability to navigate complex social landscapes, influence others, and understand the intricate dynamics of interpersonal relationships. They are vital for diplomacy, deception, and leadership.

#### Charisma
Presence, personal magnetism, and the ability to influence others through charm, confidence, or emotional appeal — whether inspiring trust, com­mand­ing respect, or bending a crowd to your will.

#### Insight
Empathy, intuition, and social sensitivity — the ability to interpret tone, read subtle cues in body language, discern hidden motives, and grasp emotional un­der­cur­rents in con­ver­sa­tions and situations.

#### Willpower
Mental fortitude, discipline, and inner resolve — the strength to resist fear, withstand stress, endure ma­nip­u­la­tion, or remain focused under o­ver­whelm­ing pressure.

## Assigning Scores
At character creation, players must determine their Seeker’s starting Aptitudes. There are no modifiers from race, background, or class: all characters begin with the same opportunities to shape their strengths. Two optional methods are provided for assigning Aptitude scores, each offering a different approach to building a balanced and unique explorer.

### Method 1: Point Buy
In the Point Buy method, all Aptitudes start at a baseline of 1. Players then have 6 additional points to distribute freely among the nine Aptitudes, allowing them to customize their character’s strengths according to their concept.

No Aptitude may be raised above 3 during character creation, ensuring a balanced distribution of abilities. The total sum of all Aptitude scores will therefore be 15, representing a capable but not overpowered Seeker.

This method offers fine control and supports specific character concepts, encouraging players to focus on one or two areas of expertise while maintaining overall versatility.

### Method 2: Pyramid Build
The Pyramid Build method provides a more structured approach to Aptitude assignment. Players allocate their scores following the shape of a pyramid:
- Primary Strength: Choose 1 Aptitude to assign a score of 3. This represents your Seeker's peak talent — their most defining trait.
- Core Competencies: Assign a score of 2 to 3 Aptitudes. These are reliable areas of capability — things your Seeker has developed with some experience.
- Underdeveloped Areas: The remaining 5 Aptitudes stay at a base score of 1. These may represent untapped potential, weaknesses, or simply unexplored paths.
This structure results in a total of 15 Aptitude points, just like the Point Buy method, but with a natural focus in a single area and a more organic distribution across the others.

Both methods aim to balance narrative flexibility with mechanical clarity. Game Masters are encouraged to allow one or both options during character creation, or to offer additional points in high-powered campaigns to fit their desired tone and challenge level.

## Using Aptitudes in Play

In Seeker, Aptitudes serve as the foundation for nearly every action a character attempts, shaping both the narrative and mechanical resolution. When a player declares an action, the Game Master (GM) determines which Aptitude(s) best represent the character’s effort in that moment.

The core mechanic for resolving actions is the Twin Coil System, which relies on rolling Action Dice and Risk Dice. Aptitude scores directly influence the number of Action Dice a character rolls, representing their skill and capability in that area.

### Determining Aptitudes for an Action
When a character attempts a task, the GM identifies the primary Aptitude that governs the action. For example:
- Breaking down a door calls for Strength.
- Climbing a cliff involves Agility.
- Noticing a hidden trap uses Perception.
- Negotiating a delicate alliance requires Charisma.
Some complex tasks may involve multiple Aptitudes. In these cases, the GM may call for multiple rolls or allow the player to choose which Aptitude to apply, depending on the situation.

### Rolling the Dice
The number of Action Dice rolled equals the character’s Aptitude score for the relevant attribute. Each die showing 5 6 counts as a success. Successes allow the character to overcome the challenge.
Risk Dice represent potential complications or consequences and are assigned by the GM based on the difficulty or danger involved. Any 6 triggers a complication, regardless of success or failure.
This mechanic adds narrative depth by rewarding characters who act in ways consistent with their chosen style, while increasing risk when they stray from it.

### Interpreting Results
The number of successes on Action Dice determines the degree of success, from barely succeeding to spectacular feats. The presence of complications from Risk Dice introduces tension and narrative twists, even in success.

# Character Level and Experience
## Core Concept

In Seeker, growth is not linear—it is lived. Your character does not simply accumulate a universal XP number until they “ding.” Instead, they grow through action and specialization, gaining power in the areas where they take risks and make impact.

Experience is divided into three distinct Tracks, each representing a core axis of gameplay. These Tracks progress independently. You don’t level up in general—you level up in what you do.:
#### Combat XP (CXP)
Earned by battles, tactics, and surviving danger.

#### Social XP (SXP)
Gained through persuasion, diplomacy, and relationships.

#### Exploration XP (EXP)
Awarded for discovery, lore, travel, and investigation.

### Independent Progression
Each of the three Tracks—Combat, Social, and Exploration—has its own XP track and levels up independently. Your character does not grow in all things at once, but in the domains where they act, take risks, and make their mark.

A Seeker might be a veteran of lost frontiers (Exploration Level 4) yet untested in war (Combat Level 1). This asymmetry reflects a natural evolution shaped by choices, encounters, and personal focus—not by a rigid class or leveling path.

## Earning XP
At the end of each gaming session, or upon reaching significant narrative milestones (such as completing a major quest, overcoming a difficult challenge, or achieving a personal character goal), the Game Master (GM) evaluates the players’ actions and contributions. The GM then awards Experience Points (XP) individually in each of the three Tracks — Combat, Social, and Exploration — reflecting the specific areas where the characters made meaningful impact.

XP awards typically range from 0 to 3 points per Track per session or milestone, depending on the importance, difficulty, and relevance of the actions taken. For example: a daring battle might merit full XP in Combat, while minor skirmishes earn fewer points. Similarly, successful negotiations or insightful discoveries grant XP in the Social or Exploration Tracks respectively.

This flexible system allows the GM to tailor rewards based on the story’s flow and the players’ focus, encouraging characters to develop along the lines of their choices and playstyle rather than through arbitrary point accrual. It is important to note that XP awards are cumulative and independent for each Track, supporting asymmetrical character growth.

## From XP to Levels
Each Track—Combat, Social, or Exploration—has its own XP progression. Every 5 XP earned in a given Track results in a Level Up within that domain. Progress is tracked separately for each Track, reflecting a character’s specific areas of activity.

### Maximum Level Cap
The maximum Level a character can reach in any single Track is Level 10. This represents the pinnacle of skill and influence within that domain, and typically marks the end point for progression in that area during the campaign.

### Asymmetrical Growth
Characters in Seeker are meant to grow unevenly, based on the actions they take and the situations they prioritize. It’s common to see characters with highly divergent progression—for example, Level 4 in Exploration, Level 3 in Combat, and Level 1 in Social. This asymmetry reflects organic, choice-driven development rather than forced balance.

## Advancements
Every new Level gained in a Track grants an Advancement—a player-chosen benefit from that Track’s menu. Advancements may include Aptitude increases, new abilities, combat maneuvers, exploration skills, social tools, or unique perks tied to the character’s growth. Each Advancement represents a tangible, thematic evolution of the Seeker’s capabilities.

Every new level unlocks an Advancement—a choice from that Track’s menu.

#### Combat Track
Strengthen your martial prowess and battlefield resilience. Leveling up in the Combat Track empowers you with raw might, tactical skills, and the capacity to survive—and triumph—in violent encounters.
- +1 Strength Strength, Agility Agility, or Vigor Vigor
- Gain 1 new Attack, Maneuver, or Defense Skill
- +2 Health
- Unlock 1 new Combat Mastery

#### Social Track
Hone your influence, empathy, and ability to shape hearts and minds. Leveling up in the Social Track enhances your capacity to manipulate, inspire, or connect with others—whether in courtly intrigue or desperate negotiations.
- +1 Charisma Charisma, Insight Insight, or Willpower Willpower
- Gain 1 new Support, Deception, or Influence Skill
- Unlock 1 new Social Mastery

#### Exploration Track
Expand your knowledge, adaptability, and resourcefulness in uncharted territories. The Exploration Track improves your capacity to uncover secrets, survive the unknown, and master the mutable world.
- +1 Perception Perception, Intellect Intellect, or Adaptability Adaptability
- Gain 1 new Utility, Information, or Movement Skill
- Unlock 1 new Exploration Mastery

### Capstone Levels
When you reach Level 10 in a Track, gain a once-in-a-lifetime Capstone Ability tied to that domain.

# Guard, Armor & Health
In Seeker, your character’s ability to endure wounds, hardship, and the dangers of exploration is represented by a layered health system. Rather than relying on a single pool of hit points, the game divides incoming harm across three distinct defensive layers: Guard, Armor, and Health.

Each layer reflects a different kind of resilience—tactical readiness, physical protection, and raw vitality. When your character suffers harm, that damage flows through these layers in a specific order, with each one absorbing part of the impact before the next is affected.

At the heart of Seeker's system are two fundamental concepts:

Damage: The universal measure of harm inflicted upon your character—whether from a sword strike, a fiery spell, or a crushing fall.
Depletion: When a defensive layer absorbs damage, its current value is reduced. If the incoming damage exceeds what remains in that layer, the layer is depleted, and any leftover harm (called overflow damage) carries over to the next layer.
This layered structure adds both narrative clarity and tactical depth. It rewards smart decision-making, preparation, and risk management—making every point of damage matter.

## The Three Layers of Defense
### Guard
Guard (Guard) represents your character’s moment-to-moment combat readiness—the ability to deflect, parry, dodge, or anticipate harm before it hits. It is a temporary, tactical layer of defense that reflects alertness and active engagement.

- How It Works
Guard is a numeric value that starts at 0 at the beginning of combat, unless modified by specific Masteries or effects. Certain Skills allow you to gain Guard during your turn. When you suffer damage, Guard is checked first. If your Guard value is greater than 0, that damage is absorbed by Guard before affecting other defenses.

- When It Applies
Guard only protects you while it has value. If your Guard is at 0, you are considered Off-Guard, and damage bypasses this layer entirely. Guard is usually lost at the moment it absorbs damage, and does not persist outside of combat unless explicitly stated.

- How to Interact With It
Many Skills and Masteries grant Guard as a result of defensive actions or successful rolls. Some enemies may attempt to remove or bypass your Guard through surprise, distraction, or overwhelming force. Guard cannot be repaired or healed—it must be regained through actions.

### Armor
Armor
Armor (Armor) represents your character’s physical protection—gear, plating, clothing, or magical shielding designed to reduce harm. Unlike Guard, Armor is not tactical or reactive; it is enduring and passive, forming the solid middle layer between your readiness and your body.

- How It Works
Armor is a numeric value granted by your equipment, magical protections, or certain Masteries. When damage bypasses Guard—or if you are Off-Guard—Armor is the next layer to absorb it. Damage reduces your current Armor value. Once it reaches 0, Armor is considered depleted and can no longer offer protection until it is repaired.

- When It Applies
Armor applies whenever damage reaches it. It does not require activation or management in combat. However, not all types of damage are effective against Armor. Certain effects (e.g., disease, fire, psychic attacks) may ignore or partially bypass it.

- How to Interact With It
Armor can be enhanced or altered through equipment choices, magical items, and Masteries. After being depleted, it must be repaired—usually as part of a downtime Activity. Some enemies may target your Armor directly, attempting to destroy or weaken it before reaching your Health.

### Health
Health (Health) is the final and most vital layer of defense: it represents your character’s stamina, vitality, and physical integrity. Once this layer is harmed, you are no longer resisting damage—you are truly being wounded.

- How It Works
Health is a fixed value based on your Vigor Aptitude, Masteries, and level-up choices. Damage only affects Health once both Guard and Armor have been depleted. When your Health reaches 0, your character dies.

- When It Applies
Health is only affected by damage that passes through Guard and Armor, or by specific effects that bypass those layers (such as poison, internal injuries, or magical corruption). Because it reflects lasting harm, Health does not recover automatically after combat.

- How to Interact With It
Health can be restored through healing effects, medical skills, magical items, or resting during downtime. Some Talents or rare effects may allow you to delay or mitigate lethal blows, but in most cases, damage to Health is serious and persistent.

## Flow of Damage
When your character suffers any amount of damage, that harm flows through your layers of defense in a specific order. Each layer tries to absorb the damage; if it cannot fully do so, the remaining damage continues to the next. Follow this sequence:

1. Check Guard First
- If your current Guard is greater than 0, the incoming damage is applied to Guard first.
- If Guard absorbs all the damage, the process ends.
If the damage exceeds your Guard, subtract what you can and pass the overflow damage to Armor.
- If your Guard is 0, you are considered Off-Guard, and Guard is skipped entirely.

2. Apply Damage to Armor
- If any damage remains after Guard (or if you were Off-Guard), it is applied to your current Armor.
- If Armor absorbs all the remaining damage, the process ends.
- If the damage exceeds your Armor, subtract what you can and pass the overflow damage to Health.
- Some types of damage may bypass Armor partially or completely.

3. Apply Damage to Health
- Any damage that remains after Armor is applied directly to your Health.
- This represents serious injury, lasting harm, or physical trauma.
- If your Health reaches 0, your character dies.
