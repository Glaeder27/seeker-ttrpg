# Twin Coil System – Full Rule Reference (v1.1)

*Updated terminology: **Action Dice** (formerly A Dice) & **Risk Dice** (formerly B Dice)*

---

## 🌀 Core Concept

The **Twin Coil System** is a lightweight, modular dice‑resolution mechanic that produces **non‑binary outcomes** by balancing a character’s **intent** against the **risk** inherent in the world.

Every roll intertwines two opposing forces:

| Coil | Dice Type | What it Represents |
|------|-----------|--------------------|
| **Active Coil** | **Action Dice** | The effort, skill, or will a character invests to achieve a goal. |
| **Passive Coil** | **Risk Dice** | The danger, resistance, or chaos that might disrupt the action. |

These forces **do not cancel each other**; they combine to generate richly textured results.

---

## 🎲 Dice Structure

The system uses **standard six‑sided dice (d6)** split into two pools:

| Dice | Symbol | Name | Description |
|------|--------|------|-------------|
| 🎯 | d6 | **Action Dice** | Rolled by the player; measure competence and intent. |
| ⚠️ | d6 | **Risk Dice** | Rolled by the GM (or procedure); measure external danger. |

---

### 🎯 Rolling the Dice

1. **Build the Pools**  
   • The player rolls a number of **Action Dice** equal to their relevant attribute, skill, or trait.  
   • The GM rolls a number of **Risk Dice** equal to the situation’s threat level.
2. **Roll Simultaneously.**  
3. **Interpret Results:**
   - **Action Die** shows **5 or 6 → Success**.  
   - **Risk Die** shows **6 → Complication**.

> Successes and Complications are **independent**. A roll may succeed *and* spawn complications.

## ✅ Success Probabilities (Action Dice)

| Action Dice | ≥1 Success (5‑6) |
|-------------|-----------------|
| 1 | 33.3 % |
| 2 | 55.6 % |
| 3 | 70.4 % |
| 4 | 80.2 % |
| 5 | 87.0 % |
| 6 | 91.3 % |
| 7 | 94.0 % |
| 8 | 95.9 % |
| 9 | 97.1 % |
| 10 | 97.9 % |

---

## ☠️ Complication Probabilities (Risk Dice)

| Risk Dice | ≥1 Complication (6) |
|-----------|---------------------|
| 1 | 16.7 % |
| 2 | 30.6 % |
| 3 | 42.1 % |
| 4 | 51.8 % |
| 5 | 59.8 % |
| 6 | 66.5 % |
| 7 | 72.2 % |
| 8 | 77.0 % |
| 9 | 81.0 % |
| 10 | 84.3 % |

## 🎭 Outcome Matrix

| Action Dice (Success?) | Risk Dice (Complication?) | Outcome | Narrative Guidance |
|------------------------|----------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| **No Successes** | **No Complications** | **Simple Failure** | The attempt fails cleanly. |
| **No Successes** | **≥1 Complication** | **Failure + Complication** | The attempt fails *and* a new problem emerges. |
| **≥1 Success** | **No Complications** | **Clean Success** | The attempt succeeds with no downside. |
| **≥1 Success** | **≥1 Complication** | **Success + Complication** | The attempt succeeds, but something else goes wrong. |

---

## 📚 Narrative Examples

| Scenario | Action Dice | Risk Dice | Example Outcome |
|----------|-------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Quietly pick a lock | 3 | 2 | **Success + Complication** → You unlock the door, but a tool clatters; nearby guards take notice. |
| Scale a wet cliff | 4 | 3 | **Failure + Complication** → You slip short of the ledge and dislodge stones, alerting watchers below. |
| Throw a knockout punch | 5 | 0 | **Clean Success** → The target drops with zero fuss. |
| Cast unstable magic | 4 | 4 | **Success + Complication** → The spell works, but arcane backlash scorches the ground. |

## 🛠 Optional Extensions

### 1. Degrees of Success
Each 5‑6 on an Action Die counts as **1 Success Point**.
- 1 point → Basic success.
- 2 points → Strong success (faster, higher quality).
- 3+ points → Critical success (bonus effect, lasting benefit).

### 2. Degrees of Complication
Each 6 on a Risk Die counts as **1 Complication Point**.
- 1 point → Minor setback (noise, time, attention).
- 2 points → Serious problem (injury, equipment damage).
- 3+ points → Catastrophic twist (collapse, exposure, magical surge).

### 3. Push Mechanic
Once per roll, a player may **re‑roll one failed Action Die** by either:
- Accepting **+1 Risk Die**, **or**
- Spending a resource (luck, stress, focus, etc.).

---

## 🧠 Design Notes

- **Competence Scales Clearly:** From 1 to 5 Action Dice, success odds climb from ~33 % to ~87 %.
- **Risk Is Modular:** GM can dial Risk Dice up or down without altering player math.
- **Four Crisp Outcomes:** Always easy to interpret at the table.
- **No Special Dice Needed:** Works with any standard d6.
