                <p>In Seeker, combat is not governed by random initiative rolls or rigid turn orders. Instead, each
                    round begins with a deliberate choice: the Stance.</p>
                <p>A Stance represents a character‚Äôs tactical posture ‚Äî their mindset and readiness in the face of
                    conflict. It dictates how fast they act, what kind of skills they can use, and how effectively they
                    can respond to threats.</p>
                <p>Each Stance is more than a mechanical category: it reflects the character's immediate priorities,
                    whether it's charging into battle, defending allies, repositioning, observing the field, or
                    channeling arcane forces. Committing to a Stance means embracing both its advantages and its
                    limitations.</p>

                    <p>
                        At the beginning of each combat round, every character selects a <strong>Stance</strong>. A
                        Stance defines your posture in the conflict ‚Äî whether you're striking first, playing
                        defensively, or focusing on magic, positioning, or observation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Your chosen Stance determines:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>How many Actions</strong> you receive this round</li>
                        <li><strong>Which Tags</strong> your Skills must have to be usable</li>
                        <li><strong>Your position in the turn order</strong>, based on stance priority</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Each Stance supports a different combat role. Choose one that aligns with your intentions for
                        the round ‚Äî offense, defense, movement, support, magic, or versatility.

                                    The Aggressive Stance is best used when you want to seize initiative and apply
                                    immediate pressure on your foes. It favors players who prefer to dictate the pace of
                                    combat, aiming to disable or eliminate high-priority targets early.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In a system where attacks are only avoided through active defense, this stance
                                    shines when used against foes who are out of position, low on Action Dice, or locked
                                    in slower postures. With 8 Actions at your disposal, you can launch powerful opening
                                    strikes, escalate when challenged, and keep your enemies off-balance with relentless
                                    offense.

                                    Defensive Stance is ideal for players who want to absorb aggression, counter enemy
                                    momentum, and control the tempo of the fight by denying opponents easy openings. In
                                    a system where defense requires deliberate investment, this stance is often the
                                    difference between survival and defeat.

                    Initiative Order
                    <span class="section-ornament">‚∏∫ ‚ú¶ ‚∏∫</span>
                </h2>
                <p>At the beginning of every combat round, all participants ‚Äî both PCs and NPCs ‚Äî simultaneously choose
                    a Stance. This decision isn't made lightly: it sets the rhythm for everything that follows.
                <p>Your chosen Stance determines:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your initiative priority ‚Äî who acts before whom</li>

                    <li>Which Tags you can use ‚Äî what kinds of skills are available to you this round</li>

                    <li>How many Actions you can spend ‚Äî and on which types of abilities</li>

                    <li>Whether you can defend yourself actively ‚Äî some Stances leave you vulnerable</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This system replaces traditional initiative rolls with a tactical layer that rewards foresight,
                    coordination, and risk assessment. Choosing a fast stance lets you strike first, but often
                    sacrifices stance. Choosing a slow or reactive stance allows you to observe, support, or shield
                    others ‚Äî but it might mean taking the first blow.</p>

                <p>Rather than reacting to chance, players must anticipate threats, read the battlefield, and commit to
                    a course of action before the first move is even made.</p>
                <h3>Making It Flow ‚Äî Running Stances Smoothly</h3>
                <p>While the Stance system offers deep tactical choices, it can feel slower than traditional initiative
                    rolls ‚Äî especially during a group‚Äôs first few sessions. To keep the pace tight and engaging, Seeker
                    encourages the use of quick physical tools and a clear round structure. Below are two techniques
                    that make Stance-based rounds smoother and more immersive.</p>

                <h4>Stance Cards</h4>
                <p>Each player receives a set of Stance Cards, one for each of the six core stances (Aggressive,
                    Defensive, Evasive, Balanced, Mystic, Inquisitive). These cards are included in official Seeker
                    materials, but can also be easily printed or written on index cards.</p>

                <p>At the beginning of each round, after the GM announces ‚ÄúChoose your Stance,‚Äù all players place their
                    selected card face-down on the table. Once everyone is ready, the GM signals to reveal all cards
                    simultaneously. The round then proceeds according to the declared stances.</p>

                <p>This method adds a tactile and visual element to the system, making the moment of choice feel
                    deliberate and dramatic ‚Äî while also preventing players from metagaming based on others‚Äô decisions.
                </p>

                <h4>Calling Initiative</h4>
                <p>After all Stances are revealed, there's no need to calculate who goes first. The GM simply calls out
                    each Stance in priority order, following the established list (Aggressive ‚Üí Evasive ‚Üí Balanced ‚Üí
                    Mystic ‚Üí Defensive ‚Üí Inquisitive).</p>
                <p>When the GM says, for example, ‚ÄúAggressive Stance!‚Äù, all characters who chose Aggressive act in any
                    agreed order (see Turn Order Resolution for tie-breaking options). Once they‚Äôve finished, the GM
                    calls ‚ÄúEvasive Stance!‚Äù, and so on, until all turns are complete.</p>

                <p>This approach eliminates unnecessary sorting or comparison between characters and keeps the focus on
                    action. It also gives the GM a natural rhythm for guiding the flow of combat.</p>
