            <p><strong>Isla de los Ojos</strong> (lit. "<em>Island of Eyes</em>") is a mutable and arcane landmass
                situated within the <strong>Lucayan Archipelago</strong>, somewhere between the islands known today as
                Cuba and Hispaniola. Though small in scale, the island holds a place of disproportionate dread and
                fascination among explorers, occult cartographers, and Seeker operatives.</p>

            <p>Since its alleged first sighting by <strong>Christopher Columbus</strong> during his second voyage in
                1493, the island has consistently defied traditional mapping. Its coasts shift with the tides, its
                interior paths reconfigure with the lunar cycle, and structures seen one day may vanish the next. Most
                unnervingly, its infamous Mirror Pools ‚Äî shallow, glassy tidal basins ‚Äî reflect not the sky, but the
                inner memories and buried traumas of those who gaze into them. Encounters with the island often lead to
                memory loss, hallucinations, or psychic residue that follows Seekers back to the mainland.</p>

            <p>The Spanish Crown declared the island <em>‚ÄúInexpugnabilis et Malevolentis‚Äù</em> ‚Äî unconquerable and
                malevolent ‚Äî in a sealed decree issued by <strong>King Ferdinand II of Aragon</strong> after a failed
                military operation in 1495. Despite this, both Spanish and British operatives have continued to dispatch
                Seekers to the island in hopes of retrieving arcane artifacts, charting its mutable geography, or
                locating the rumored Eye at the Center, a mythical structure believed to hold predictive knowledge or
                divine vision.</p>

            <p>While indigenous Lucayan legends speak of the island as a place where the land sees, the island‚Äôs
                existence remains officially unacknowledged by most modern institutions. No two charts of the island
                agree; in fact, some maps record it as <strong>existing in multiple locations at once</strong>. As of
                the latest field reports, Isla de los Ojos is classified by the Seeker Codex as a <strong>Tier III
                    Unstable Zone</strong>, with only partially secured landing sectors and limited exit reliability.

                The island consists of three major biomes: limestone highlands, tidal mangrove deltas, and
                memory-reactive beachhead pools. A central spine of white stone, the <strong>Camino del Cielo</strong>,
                physically shifts each night, tilting 3 degrees southward before realigning at sunrise. Compass readings
                within 500 meters of this formation become increasingly unreliable.
            </p>
            <p>
                Four known <strong>Mirror Pools</strong> surround the coastline, each with unique reflective properties.
                Seeker scribes theorize they are connected to the Dream Veil, acting as surface-level rifts into
                subconscious spatial logic. Flora includes the <em>Sanguine Mangrove</em>, whose root structures have
                been observed shifting toward body heat, and <em>Star Orchids</em>, which only bloom under celestial
                anomalies.
